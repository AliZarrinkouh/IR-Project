Their organization has helped bring adaptive sports -- including Adaptive Snowboarder X, Adaptive Skier X, Mono X, Adaptive Skateboarding, and Adaptive Moto X to the X Games and now to the Paralympics. Xavier Gonzalez, CEO of the International Paralympic Committee, announced in May that Para-Snowboarding will make its Paralympic debut with the addition of men's and women's Adaptive Boardercross as a medal sport at the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, with qualifiers beginning in January, 2013.

The Amazing Race premieres at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, and while CBS executives wouldn't let any secrets out about how the race shakes out, we were able to catch up with Purdy, a double beneath-the-knee amputee and the top-ranked female adaptive snowboarder in the United States, and Gale, who has served as sports organizer for all of the adaptive events at X Games over the past seven years, for a sneak preview of their race around the world and the even more exciting races ahead. Purdy and dozens of other athletes working with Adaptive Action Sports will train for qualifying events on the road to the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

Amy Purdy: The Amazing Race is everything that you would expect it to be and more. I think it's going to be a great platform for my message, which is that it's not really about me trying to show how able or how capable I am so much as that we're all able, we're all capable. We all have challenges and we all face adversities. We all have to adapt. The Amazing Race is perfect for me because it's all about adventure and travel and taking risks and throwing yourself out there and challenging yourself. That's what I've been doing with my life anyways, so it's a beautiful platform to be able to take that to a bigger audience. I really do feel blessed.

Daniel Gale: Well, first of all, co-founding an organization like Adaptive Action Sports is a huge undertaking, especially for such a deserving community of people, and setting out to run an organization like that heightens your drive to achieve and set goals and really strive to meet those goals. Translating that into an adventure like The Amazing Race, I think the biggest thing we've learned from our experiences together is that whatever comes along, you have to adapt quickly! That's something we say to our new athletes who are just coming on board with Adaptive Action Sports and it's something we've learned from a lot of the athletes we work with: If there's a will there's a way. That's sort of a cliche, but it's so true. People adapt to make things happen if they really want them to. We took that mentality into The Amazing Race and we really try to live that way.

Purdy: Running the organization has been a challenge for us all along because Daniel and I are also a couple and we work together as business partners. We wear lots of different hats in our relationship, and I think because of that we know where we can push buttons and we know how to communicate with each other under different circumstances and different challenges. We don't always communicate awesomely, but going onto the race we felt really confident because of knowing each other as well as we do.

Last year I caught up with snowboarders Andy Finch and Tommy Czeschin as they were getting ready to premiere in Season 19 of the race. They ended up doing pretty well, ultimately finishing in fourth place. Did you get a chance to chat with them to get any tips before your race?



Gale: We know those guys but we never really had a chance to powwow because everything happened pretty quickly once we found out we were racing. But we're huge fans of those two and we loved the way they ran their race. We took whatever notes we could from watching them in Season 19.

Purdy: We were really inspired by their attitudes going into the race and how well they worked together. We definitely took that with us and kept them in the back of our mind as role models. I think it's good to see racers on the show who aren't always super dramatic, who are just entertaining because of who they are.

What was your reaction after the Paralympic announcement was made in May? This would have been right around the time you were first preparing for The Amazing Race, right?



Purdy: It's so exciting it's crazy. Everything in my life has just been getting more and more amazing. When I did the TED speech for TEDxOrangeCoast in 2011 and it went viral, I thought, ""Oh my gosh, this is just incredible."" This is what I set out to do: I wanted to speak, I wanted to have a platform, and I got that opportunity and thought, ""I just don't know if it gets any more amazing than this."" And then we get offered the opportunity to go on The Amazing Race and I'm thinking, ""This is insane!"" We're huge fans of the show and we knew it would be another incredible platform. And then literally just before going on the race we find out that the Paralympics have accepted snowboarding! We'd originally been denied last summer and had given up on it for 2014 and gone back to our normal lives, and then, suddenly, it was on. Now we're working so much on what's to come that we've barely even had time to process it all. We just moved to Summit County in Colorado and I'll be training out here probably six days a week for the next two years.

What do you think turned the International Paralympic Committee around and got snowboarding fast-tracked for Sochi?



Purdy: Honestly, I think it was seeing it at the X Games. The X Games opened their arms to us and gave us the opportunity to showcase our sport in a world-class venue, and that was a huge help because it allowed us to show the rest of the world -- and the Paralympic Committee -- what we're capable of.

What does the qualification process for the Paralympics look like over the next two years?



Purdy: This year I have to do four qualifiers. I'm the top-ranked rider in the U.S. and last year I was the top-ranked in the world, but even though I have those credentials they're pretty much wiping the slate clean and everybody has to qualify. I am working harder than ever to qualify for the team because this is really a dream come true. I was 19 when I lost my legs. I'd dreamt of this adventurous life that I wanted to live, and I refused to let it get out of reach. I remember thinking, early on, after I realized that I could still snowboard, ""If snowboarding is ever in the Paralympics, I'm absolutely going to be there."" It's just so cool that we were able to help get it there and that my dream has made a lot of amazing things happen. Now that I actually get to try to qualify for the team, the next two years are going to be incredibly busy. I've never been so excited to be so busy.

The Adaptive Action Sports motto is ""Live Beyond Limits."" What do you hope people take away from seeing you compete on The Amazing Race?



Purdy: I think the thing people love about the show and the reason it's so popular for fans is that it's real, everyday people racing. I hope people see us and see that we're real people with real challenges who have worked really hard to get to where we are, to live beyond limits. I hope the take-away is that if you work hard, anything's possible. We try to live every day of our lives as a great adventure, and we're just really excited that we get to share that experience with everybody else who's watching.

Gale: Amy is an amazing person and it's an honor to be on the race and be her teammate, on the show and in everything else we do. Hopefully she'll crush it at the Paralympics -- I know she will -- and if people want to support our Paralympic efforts they can visit AdaptiveActionSports.org to learn more about our work and to make a donation to help her train and to help the many other athletes we're working with."
1,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4982607/is-landon-donovan-being-hypocritical,Is Landon Donovan being hypocritical?,"Donovan's situation differs from that of Beckham a year ago

I wonder if David Beckham has afforded himself a wry smile at the irony of this week's statements from Landon Donovan, in which he said he would like to skip the start of the MLS season in order to lengthen his stay with Everton.

What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, as Donovan prepared for the new MLS season with the L.A. Galaxy, his hackles were raised by Beckham's successful lobbying for an extension to his loan at AC Milan, and Donovan went public with his criticism, claiming that, among other things, the Englishman was not committed to coach Bruce Arena's side.

For Los Angeles, the knock-on effect was having to play the opening 3Â½ months of 2009 without one-half of its most dynamic duo. When Beckham did return, the media descended on the Home Depot Center to report on the conflict between the club's two stars, causing an unwelcome distraction for them and the rest of the team.

In the months following, Donovan mended fences, admitting he was ""unfair"" and that he did not give Beckham a chance to show his humility. He also signed a new contract with MLS, one of the clauses of which allowed him to seek overseas loans during the offseason. Soon afterward, a deal was struck with Everton, which led to a loan spell so successful that both player and club have sought to increase its length.

Some may claim that, given his criticism of Beckham last year, Donovan's quest for an extension of his own makes him look hypocritical and guilty of some of the same failings. However, though it is true that there are similarities between the situations, they are not completely identical.

First and foremost, like the rest of us, soccer players are fundamentally motivated by looking after ""No. 1."" Given that, the actions of Beckham a year ago and of Donovan now are understandable. Both are career-minded men who have come to see a greater benefit for themselves in playing abroad -- in the short-term at least -- than in plying their trade in MLS.

However, whereas Beckham's ultimate aim was to effectively double the length of his loan in order to finish the Serie A season with AC Milan, Donovan is on record as saying that he wants to extend his stay with Everton by just one month until April 15, which would allow him to play immediately for the Galaxy upon his return to Los Angeles.

If, that is, there are games to play in -- the specter of a possible players' strike has to be a major factor in Donovan's thinking and a major reason for the game of brinkmanship he is currently attempting to play. Returning to America only to then down tools in solidarity with his colleagues would do little for his career, especially with a World Cup looming.

Meanwhile, projecting forward to the longer term, I wonder what Donovan's thoughts are about the four-year, $9 million contract he signed in December. Does he regret putting pen to paper, or will his ambition be satisfied by a two-month sojourn in Europe every January?

Perhaps we will never find out. Such has been the impression Donovan has made in his short time at Everton. His list of suitors has grown to the extent that, if the price is right, a post-World Cup transfer back to Europe is a strong possibility -- although whether Goodison Park would become his new, permanent home would remain to be seen.

The future, though, is just that. For now, Donovan will settle for another month on Merseyside.

A thing that made me go hmmm

Donovan's future could be impacted by the latest collective bargaining agreement talks, which are due to take place this week.

After two negotiation extensions still failed to provide enough time for MLS players, the league and its owners to come to terms on a new deal, the opposing sides will return to the table along with George H. Cohen, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who will serve as mediator in the discussions.

It should be noted that Cohen's presence is in a ""nonbinding"" capacity, meaning nobody should be fooled into thinking that, at this stage, this is anything other than a small step in the right direction toward finally agreeing on a new CBA. His input may help, or it may muddy the waters further.

The fact is that the divisive issues remain the same. The players remain focused on their goals, with two of the most fundamental being free agency and guaranteed contracts, both of which the league and owners have hitherto refused to grant.

For its part, MLS is prepared to operate under the old CBA and has stated that it will not sanction a lockout. Thus, there is greater onus on the players to make something happen. Time is running short to get a deal done before the start of the regular season on March 25, a date which could, in theory, see players use the most useful piece of leverage remaining to them, which is to strike."
2,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4874485/landon-donovan-finds-comfort-zone-england,Landon Donovan finds his comfort zone in England,"It's been nothing but good news for the U.S. team lately (meaningless loss to Honduras aside). The injury updates on key players like Oguchi Onyewu and Clint Dempsey appear rosy for the World Cup, and in Charlie Davies' case, there's a possibility that he could return as well.

On the field, U.S. players are continuing to make their mark in the EPL. Dempsey was arguably Fulham's best player before being hurt, Jonathan Spector has filled in well for the injured Herita Ilunga at West Ham and although Jozy Altidore has yet to score his first EPL goal, he's starting to contribute (he had an assist for Hull against Wolves over the weekend). Speaking of Altidore, he also managed to draw the penalty for Hull's second, although it was a soft challenge. If there's one thing you can clearly point to in Altidore's development, it's that since he's been in Europe, he's definitely learned how to embellish the effects of contact from defenders and win more free kicks. Of course, the biggest news was Landon Donovan's first goal for Everton (against Sunderland) and how he has played in general. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Donovan finds the perfect fit overseas at last. There's no doubt that Donovan has proved he belongs and has the ability to play at a very effective level in the Premiership. He's had a couple of very good outings mixed with some average outings, but that's to be expected of someone who's still adjusting to the English game (I'm admittedly surprised/impressed, though, by just how quickly he has gotten up to full speed). The key here is that he has greatly endeared himself to Everton coach David Moyes and fans alike with his work rate, his set-piece work on corners and his intelligent use of the ball in general. He has even won over the hardcore skeptics in the Everton fan base who had wondered if the move was partially due to the marketing uplift it would give the club in America (a certain element of Manchester United fans also once wondered the same thing about Park Ji-Sung).

With Donovan recently stating more or less that he's having one of the best moments of his career, it's safe to say that he'll want to stay in England. The bigger question is whether or not Everton can come up with the $11 million or so that it'll take to prise him away from the Galaxy and MLS. (There's no question Everton wants him back, but its finances are shot.) If Everton can't find the money this summer, it's likely Donovan will draw interest from some other Premiership teams, but there's no doubt that Everton is the best fit for him.

For a start, Everton mirrors the U.S. national team in the sense that it likes to put men behind the ball and defense and relies on counter-attacking and set pieces offensively. Also, Everton is one of the closest-knit squads in the Premiership, a welcome respite for Donovan from places like Bayern (or some other top-tier teams) where squad camaraderie doesn't exist on the same level. Finally, and most importantly, Donovan isn't the best player on Everton (he's the fifth- or sixth-best) and isn't expected to carry the load, which allows him to play within himself and in the flow of the game without having to force things. If he went to another team -- say, Hull, Burnley or Wigan -- there'd be a lot more pressure on him to shoulder the offensive burden.

As for his next game, it comes in the traditionally heated Merseyside derby against hated rival Liverpool (Saturday, 7:45 a.m. ET, ESPN2). If as expected, the Reds line up with defensive liability Emiliano Insua at left back, it's a matchup that Donovan could expose due to Insua's propensity to get caught out of position and lack of foot speed.

2. John Terry's days as England captain are numbered. After the latest scandal/revelation in John Terry's turbulent off-the-field life/soap opera, you have to think that England coach Fabio Capello is ready to pull the plug on Terry as captain of the English team. It was revealed in the English tabloids this past week that Terry had an affair with former best friend Wayne Bridge's girlfriend (the only question appears to be whether said girlfriend was Bridge's ex at the time, as Terry claims, or whether she was in the midst of reconciliation with Bridge, as others have claimed).

Either way, all this tabloid-speak about his personal life could be disregarded if not for Terry's litany of scandals. Who can forget his drunken taunting of American tourists in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks? Or how about recent allegations that he accepted significant sums of cash to conduct behind-the-scenes tours of Chelsea's stadium? Or how about accusations that he was seeking to profit from his England World Cup captaincy after revelations that his agents had circulated e-mails touting for commercial endorsements?

In terms of Terry's character, it's not as if the apple has fallen far from the tree either (his mother and mother-in-law were arrested for shoplifting last year). The question in footballing terms is what should Capello do about all of this, and make no mistake, Capello will do something (he already met previously with Terry about the e-mails to remind him of his ""proper"" duty as England captain).

Given his status as one of England's finest defenders, there's little to no chance that Terry is dropped from the lineup or squad (and nor should he be). However, I don't see how he can remain the English captain. Aside from the image aspect and conduct unbefitting what the captain of any national team should represent, the simple fact is that he has more than likely lost the respect of many (if not all) of his England teammates (Bridge is likely to be a member of the World Cup squad as well). A similar thing occurred in Australian Rules Football in 2002, when North Melbourne's Wayne Carey (considered one of the greatest Aussie Rules players of all time) was caught philandering with the wife of then-best friend and North Melbourne vice captain Anthony Stevens. The result? With the entire team strongly united against him and facing national condemnation, Carey resigned from the club and went on hiatus from the league for 12 months."
3,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4863372/mls-back-business-soon,MLS to be back in business soon?,"What will the players of Major League Soccer be up to at the start of next week? Although a number of teams have already convened for the beginning of preseason training, there remains the chance that, come Feb. 1, tools will be downed until a new collective bargaining agreement is reached.

Days before Sunday's expiration of the current deal, it remains unclear as to where MLS and its players are in relation to a resolution. However, the parties involved are still talking, and the impression I get is that, slowly but surely, an agreement is getting closer. It also seems that even if this weekend's deadline passes, things will be sorted out well before the start of the new season on March 25.

On the same subject, an interesting nugget popped up on the personal blog of Freddie Ljungberg on Tuesday. The Swede confirmed he would be back with the Sounders next week after he was told there would be no lockout or strike. Of course, this may mean that, as opposed to a new CBA being imminent, the ongoing negotiation period will merely be extended. A knock-on effect of that could be the non-interruption of teams' preseason schedules.

Well played, young men

If you have yet to read the interview of Charlie Davies conducted by my ESPN.com colleague Ives Galarcep, then make a point of doing so. The U.S. striker continues to make remarkable progress in his recovery following his involvement in a fatal car crash in October.

Despite all he has been through, Davies retains lofty ambitions. He intends to return to training with Sochaux by the end of February and aims to be playing again by April. Two months later, he plans to be in South Africa as part of the United States' World Cup squad. His comeback to date has been remarkable. To see him line up against England on June 12 would be nothing short of unbelievable.

Davies is rehabbing alongside another key man for the national team, Oguchi Onyewu. The AC Milan defender is also targeting a late-February return to practice, which would give him two-plus months to regain full match fitness â¦ provided he can get on the field.

An unused substitute for his new club five times in the opening six weeks of the season, Onyewu logged 31 Champions League minutes two weeks before he suffered a knee injury against Costa Rica. Since then, the Rossoneri's form has improved, but cover for first-choice central defenders Alessandro Nesta and Thiago Silva is one area in which Milan remains short -- meaning opportunities should present themselves for a healthy Onyewu.

A thing that made me go hmmm â¦

Here's hoping that Davies and Onyewu (as well as Clint Dempsey) continue to rehab smoothly, for there was little in Saturday's friendly with Honduras to suggest that the Americans' reserves are capable of stepping up to perform on the biggest of international stages.

Granted, the early red card shown to Jimmy Conrad -- could the referee not have shown a little more common sense, given the circumstances of the game? -- plunged Bob Bradley's side into a hole from which it was difficult to escape. But nonetheless, a number of potential World Cup squad members missed a chance to shine.

Most disappointing to this observer were the performances of a pair of midfielders. Despite his ability to do so, Benny Feilhaber was unable to take the game by the scruff of the neck. Meantime, the regression of Sacha Kljestan continues, with the Chivas man bearing little resemblance to the player who netted a hat trick against Sweden in the opening international of 2009.

Elsewhere, Kyle Beckerman did OK, as did Robbie Rogers and Brad Davis, whose passing acumen and set-piece delivery was a key factor in the U.S. team's best spell of the match, which came in the final 20 minutes. The Houston Dynamo defender is worthy of another look when Bradley's men take on El Salvador on Feb. 24.

Rivalries renewed in Africa

The Africa Cup of Nations semifinals take place Thursday. First, Ghana faces Nigeria, before Algeria and Egypt meet for the fourth time in the past eight months. Algeria has recovered well from its opening-game defeat to Malawi, and was worthy of its quarterfinal win against Ivory Coast, a game in which the Desert Foxes twice came from behind.

As well as beating Egypt in a World Cup playoff in November, Algeria also was the last country to beat the Pharaohs in a Cup of Nations match, all the way back in 2004. Since then, Egypt has gone 17 games without defeat and has won back-to-back championships."
4,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4857104/not-much-take-away-honduras-game,Not much to take away from Honduras game,"Clint Dempsey won't require surgery on his injured knee and will likely return to action in May. It remains to be seen what his fitness level will be after such an extended period of time on the sidelines, but early indications are that he should be healthy in time for the World Cup in June.

Now that we've got the good news out of the way, let's get to the not-so-great news.

What's that, you say? How is that the good news?

That the injury status of one of the U.S. national team's most important players has been upgraded from ""sky-is-falling disastrous"" to just plain ""unfortunate and unnerving"" has to be taken as positive news, especially after a truly troubling performance against Honduras on Saturday in the first international friendly of 2010.

In light of a growing list of injuries to essential players, you might have been hoping for a silver lining in the form of a deeper and more developed player pool, as Bob Bradley sent out what was basically a B squad. But you'd be disappointed. If you don't believe me, all you'd have to do is look at Bradley's facial expressions during the Americans' 3-1 loss in Carson, Calif. Even by his stoic and solemn standards, you could see he was not at all comforted by the display of his reserve squad.

And what exactly was he seeing? More importantly, what was he expecting? By definition, such games are meaningless. And with the exception of Benny Feilhaber, no player on display at the Home Depot Center is a shoe-in for South Africa. So the fact that the team lost was not altogether troubling. The expectation for a game like this is not in the result, but in the impression that players make. It's a tryout for the few remaining places on the final roster.

And that's what was so frustrating. The best you can say about most players was that their performance was underwhelming enough not to seriously damage their chance at getting another look in the near future. However, at the same time, no one player distinguished himself in any meaningful way.

Clearly, any criticism, observation or judgment has to be qualified with the fact that the game lost much of its impetus with the mind-numbingly bizarre decision to send off Jimmy Conrad and award a penalty before 20 minutes had ticked off the clock. But in a strange way, that's almost immaterial. While it may have left no doubt about the final result, it could have been used as an opportunity.

We've seen enough of these games to know that the result is not what's at stake. Again, it's about the impression made by players with something to prove. And playing a man down for well over an hour actually provides a unique, albeit unfortunate, scenario for players to do just that. The opportunities to get on the ball in pressure situations increases, while the pressure to actually win the game and get a result lessens.

Bradley pointed to the poor quality of his team's passing as something he was most disappointed in. The lack of rhythm and tempo, the absence of any quick passing combinations or short exchanges was clear to see. In my opinion, midfielders Feilhaber and Kyle Beckerman are most culpable on this count.

Even before Conrad was shown his second yellow and given his marching orders, it was largely the responsibility of Feilhaber and Beckerman to get on the ball and provide some balance in the passing game. The U.S. needed possession to create avenues in order to get other players, like Robbie Rogers and Sacha Kljestan, involved in the play more. Honduras wasn't overly aggressive providing pressure in the middle of the field, even with a man advantage. However, Feilhaber and Beckerman seemed overeager to dump the ball forward into the path of forwards Jeff Cunningham and Robbie Findley as a first option.

As for the Findley-Cunningham partnership, I'd have preferred to see Conor Casey get a start, but you can understand Bradley's thinking. They're players who offer similar qualities and who are somewhat unknown quantities at the international level. It's likely that it will come down to choosing one or the other (if either) for the final World Cup roster. Why not throw them out together and see who performs best? Unfortunately, the circumstances prevented them from really getting involved in the game, though you'd have to give the nod to Findley on the night for showing more initiative.

As for the defense, well, it was also downhill after Conrad's sending-off. But the fact that Jonathan Bornstein, who shifted to the center of the defense in place of Conrad, was more convincing than Chad Marshall says a lot about the Columbus man's display. Right back Marvell Wynne probably provided the most instructive lesson of the night in showing that he's not the answer at the international level, at least not yet. The physical tools are obviously there, but we can probably expect to see Kevin Alston from the New England Revolution get the nod the next time around.

And hopefully the next time around, against El Salvador in a month, we'll have something more positive than Clint Dempsey's not-so-injured knee to talk about."
5,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4849894/ranking-best-teams-europe,Ranking the best teams in Europe,"After watching Chelsea, Barcelona and Milan dismantle opponents in recent weeks, I couldn't help asking myself: If I were a manager of a European club, which teams would I least like to face right now? Well, below you will find my answers in the form of power rankings:

1. Chelsea -- Maybe Chelsea shouldn't be ranked ahead of Barcelona, but when a team scores seven goals in a game and plays with as much class as it did in its 7-2 drubbing of Sunderland, it's tough to keep them out of the top spot. Simply put, it was the best game Chelsea has played under manager Carlo Ancelotti this season. The rest of Europe will be in serious trouble once the Blues get all their players back from the African Cup on Nations.

2. Barcelona -- Talk of a mini-crisis has subsided after a couple of dominant wins in La Liga in January. Barcelona looks primed to start pulling away from Real Madrid should its rivals continue to experience road bumps. The defending Spanish champs have gone on an offensive assault in their past two league games, scoring nine goals while not conceding any.

3. Milan -- Some may feel this is too high a ranking for the Rossoneri, but since the start of the new year, this team has looked incredibly good. Milan remains an older squad but unlike past seasons it has depth to go along with a finally healthy, strong defense. The team faces a big test Sunday against city rival and league leader Inter. A win for the Rossoneri in the Milan Derby would break the Serie A season wide open.

4. Arsenal -- The young Gunners showed some grit to go along with the flair we all know they possess. A 4-2 comeback win against Bolton (after trailing 0-2) last weekend is proof that this team is ready to fight Chelsea and Manchester United for the Premier League title.

5. Real Madrid -- Just when you think this team has found its stride, it hits a road bump. A hard-fought, and frustrating, 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao dropped Madrid five points behind league leader Barcelona. I'm not quite sure what to make of the Galacticos 2.0. On paper they're one of Europe's top three teams, but they have struggled to score in recent league matches. Not having the in-form Gonzalo Higuain was a factor in Real's surprising loss last weekend, but that's not much of an excuse when you have Karim Benzema as his replacement.

6. Manchester United -- Despite a multitude of injuries, the Red Devils have put on a brave face this season and remain strong contenders in the Premier League. They rebounded nicely last weekend from a league draw against Birmingham, with a 3-0 pounding of Burnley, but again showed their vulnerability with a loss to Manchester City in the Carling Cup. The news that John O'Shea is lost for the rest of the season is just more bad news for Red Devils fans.

7. Internazionale -- I feel strange putting the Italian giants this low, particularly because they top Serie A. But in recent weeks Jose Mourinho's men have not looked that great. Sure, they demonstrated an uncharacteristic grit in their previous two league games, coming back to defeat Siena and tie Bari, but those are opponents the Nerazzuri should easily dismiss. Inter looks very susceptible heading into this weekend's derby against city rival Milan.

8. Bordeaux -- For years French soccer was dominated by Lyon, but Bordeaux is now the new bully on the block. Behind the play of French starlet Yoann Gourcuff, who was reborn at the club last season, Bordeaux continues to breeze through France's League 1 and looks like a very tough out in the Champions League.

9. Valencia -- Since the start of the new year the Spanish side has beaten all comers while playing a very attractive brand of soccer. Players like David Villa and David Silva make them extremely dangerous on the attacking end; the two were instrumental in the team's 4-1 win over Villareal on Sunday. Should Real Madrid continue to struggle, there's a very good chance Valencia will overtake them in the standings in the coming weeks.

10. Bayern Munich -- After a slow start to the season, the German giants are on a hot streak. They've now won five-straight league games, and in December they crushed Juventus to advance to the second round of the Champions League. Oh, and they did it all without the services of world-class winger Franck Ribery, who just happens to make his return this week against Werder Bremen.

Don't agree with the rankings? That's OK. Below I've included a SportsNation ranker. Re-rank this list as you see fit. Also, please feel free to share your top-10 teams in the comments section. Let the debate begin."

With two first-choice men -- Oguchi Onyewu and Charlie Davies -- already nursing serious injuries that put in doubt their participation in South Africa, Sunday's news that Clint Dempsey had sustained a knee injury initially seemed to be yet another hammer blow to Team USA's hopes this summer.

Fortunately, tests revealed that the severity of Dempsey's damage isn't as great as was first feared by his club manager, Roy Hodgson, who uttered two words you never want to hear in the same sentence of an injury update: ""cruciate"" and ""ligament."" Fulham's statement on Tuesday may have been vague and contained no specific diagnosis but, crucially, it did say that Dempsey should not require surgery and is expected to be back before the end of the Premier League season.

No player ever likes to be sidelined by an injury, but the chance to rest what must be a weary body is one that may prove beneficial for Dempsey. Since the start of the 2008-09 season, he has made 67 appearances for his club and played 18 times for his country. An enforced break provides a perfect opportunity to recharge his batteries ahead of a huge summer.

For although Dempsey has been criticized at times for his play with the national team, there is no doubt he is an absolutely vital member of Bob Bradley's side, possessing the ability to change games in a way that few others on the U.S. roster can. His versatility is important too, especially with uncertainty about Davies. I wouldn't be surprised to see Dempsey play at his best position, as a supporting striker, in South Africa.

A case for the defense

While the encouraging displays of Landon Donovan for Everton have garnered much attention in recent days, it's worth noting that he isn't the only American abroad who has impressed.

Among the defenders, Carlos Bocanegra logged 90 minutes in Ligue 1 for the first time in more than a month as Rennes drew at St. Etienne, a club to which the American captain has been linked recently. Jonathan Spector was included in the West Ham lineup to face Aston Villa and performed well against Ashley Young -- this three weeks after doing OK against another young England international, Aaron Lennon.

In Scotland, Maurice Edu appears to have made his own starting spot with Rangers' first team. Meanwhile, one of his rivals for a place in the national team midfield is bound for Germany, as Ricardo Clark agreed to join Eintracht Frankfurt.

Donovan aside, the news for other members of the U.S.' attacking fraternity has been less positive. Jozy Altidore has lost his place at Hull and will be further discouraged by the arrival of a new rival for playing time, Amr Zaki. Meanwhile, Stuart Holden's trial at Bolton was hampered by a thigh injury, though Wanderers manager Owen Coyle hasn't ruled out signing the Texan.

Good luck, contending men

With places on the U.S. World Cup squad still up for grabs, Saturday's friendly against Honduras will provide a chance to impress for a number of players. Among those I'll be following closely are Benny Feilhaber and Robbie Rogers, who could be key men this summer (especially if Dempsey is deployed as a forward), as well as Geoff Cameron. The Houston man is capable of playing in midfield, but I would prefer to see him in central defense, an area in which quality depth is a little sparser.

Beyond that trio, perhaps two stars of last year's draft class -- Kevin Alston and Omar Gonzalez -- will make their international debuts while, at the other end of the age and experience scale, Jimmy Conrad and Jeff Cunningham have another chance to show they have something left to offer.

A thing that made me go hmmm â¦

After a slow start, Africa's World Cup-qualified countries have found their form in the African Cup of Nations. Bouncing back from its opening-match loss to Malawi, Algeria -- a group opponent for the U.S. on June 23 -- claimed a win and a draw against Mali (1-0) and Angola (0-0), respectively (although just one goal scored in three games will concern coach Rabah Saadane). In the quarterfinals, Algeria will meet Ivory Coast, which was impressive in its 3-1 disposal of Ghana.

The Black Stars, whom the U.S. could face in the second round in South Africa, overcame that defeat and the injury loss of their inspirational captain, Michael Essien, to beat Burkina Faso and clinch a knockout-stage tie against the host nation. Meanwhile, Nigeria put together back-to-back wins to reach the last eight. Cameroon would also advance by avoiding defeat against Tunisia on Thursday."
7,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4827623/is-ronaldinho-rebirth-brazil-gain,Is Ronaldinho's rebirth Brazil's gain?,"Only nine months ago, it appeared Ronaldinho's international career may be coming to an end. A forgettable first season at AC Milan, one in which he often struggled to get playing time, ensured that the two-time FIFA World Player of the Year did not get a call-up to the Brazilian national team for the Confederations Cup or the team's final World Cup qualifying push. But a recent run of good form has left the door open for his possible return to the SelÃ©Ã§ao just in time for the 2010 World Cup.

Times are good for Milan, particularly for Ronaldinho, who has found a new home with a club that has always had a taste for signing Brazilian players -- whether they be good (KakÃ¡), bad (Ricardo Oliveira) or past their prime (Ronaldo). After last season, it appeared Ronaldinho, 29, was destined for the latter designation. But a new season, as well as a new manager, have rejuvenated Ronaldinho, who is playing with an energy and a focus unseen in recent years.

Despite the resurgence in his game, this isn't the same player who dominated the middle of the decade. Gone is the explosive creativity, now replaced by chips, well-weighted passes and an occasional burst down the wing. And although his performance this season has never approached the level of his golden period with Barcelona, Dinho has injected a great deal of excitement into a club in desperate need of just that.

So when he scored two goals in Milan's 3-0 demolition of rival Juventus on Sunday, it was natural for talk of a return to the Brazilian national team to heat up. It also helped that only weeks earlier, Brazil manager Carlos Dunga said he was open to the player's return.

But is calling up Ronaldinho to the national team worth the risk to Dunga? Certainly a spot could be found for Dinho somewhere on the bench, and there is even an argument to be made that he could replace Robinho in the starting XI, given Robinho's current struggles at Manchester City. But in my opinion, Ronaldinho's addition would be an unnecessary risk for Dunga given the central role KakÃ¡ now plays with the national team and the poor track record the two players have had as teammates (see Brazil 2006 and Milan 2007).

It's hard to imagine that reuniting the two stars for a third time would yield different, more successful results -- the main reason being that both Ronaldinho and KakÃ¡ need to see a lot of the ball to be effective. And although Dinho may have reinvented himself in recent years, the man still needs to get a lot of touches to influence a game. Can those touches be provided without affecting Brazil's current equilibrium? Doubtful.

And even if Ronaldinho were relegated to the bench, away from the team's current starting lineup, an ace in Dunga's back pocket to be used in case of emergency, it would create too much of a distraction. One poor opening-round performance this summer -- a very real possibility given that Brazil will have to face Portugal and the Ivory Coast -- will give rise to cries for Dinho's inclusion in the starting lineup, an added distraction for a coach and team that seem to have it all figured out at the moment.

Oh, the hardships of having too big a talent pool to choose from! But seriously, this will not be an easy or fun decision for Dunga, if Ronaldinho keeps up this run of form.

For now, we wait. Regardless of what the final verdict may be, however, it's nice to see Ronaldinho back in form and enjoying the game again."
8,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4820504/algeria-holes-us-gains,Algeria's holes are the U.S.' gains,"While the national team's training camp continues in California, Bob Bradley will no doubt have an eye on Angola, where one of the U.S.' World Cup Group C opponents, Algeria, has started poorly in its Africa Cup of Nations campaign.

The Desert Foxes were beaten 3-0 by Malawi on Monday, a result that was called ""a lesson in humility"" by their coach, Rabah Saadane, whose starting 11 featured nine European-based players. Algeria was ineffective in attack and porous at the back, where each goal conceded offered confidence to the U.S. ahead of the countries' June 23 showdown.

Algeria's preparations for the tournament were hampered on its eve by the withdrawal of experienced goalkeeper Lounes Gaouaoui, who has acute appendicitis. His replacement, Faouzi Chaouchi, had impressed in shutting out Egypt in November's World Cup play-in game but was unable to repeat his heroics against Malawi, with two of those goals following his mistakes.

Not that Chaouchi was solely to blame for the defensive lapses. Malawi's opener came after Madjid Bougherra -- a teammate at Rangers of Maurice Edu and DaMarcus Beasley -- played two attackers onside before compounding his error by colliding with his goalkeeper, resulting in a botched Chaouchi clearance, which presented Russel Mwafulirwa with an open net.

Malawi's second and third goals indicated how much Algeria misses the injured Antar Yahia, whose goal two months ago clinched a spot in South Africa, in defense and implied a weakness against the crossed ball, which the U.S. can look to exploit.

First, Elvis Kafoteka got in between two defenders to head in a left-wing delivery before halftime. The result was sealed shortly after the interval when, after Chaouchi weakly punched a center from the right, David Banda fired home from close range.

Algeria, which will look to improve against Mali on Thursday, is not the only World Cup-bound nation to start slowly at the Cup of Nations. Nigeria was beaten by defending champions Egypt, and Cameroon lost to Gabon, while Ivory Coast could not find a way past Burkina Faso, despite registering 22 shots.

Holden to Bolton

Stuart Holden had to be patient but finally has his chance to impress Owen Coyle. The Scottish-born Texan is on trial with Bolton this week after his would-be new manager, having quit Burnley, took over at the Reebok Stadium.

On the face of it, having to go on trial seems a little disrespectful. Holden will face a test of his character, as well as his ability, while he attempts to impress prospective new teammates, several of whom will feel he is a threat to their jobs.

However, Holden in good stead because of the belief that Coyle appears to have in him. It would have been very easy to have pushed the midfielder to one side while he gets his feet under the table in his new role, but the fact that Coyle has called him in before he has even taken charge of Bolton in a game suggests a contract is Holden's for the taking.

The respective merits of Bolton and Burnley is a debate that has raged, with Coyle as its subject, for several weeks. From Holden's point of view, playing consistently in the Premier League is more important than for which club he turns out. Bolton's squad is slightly bigger than is Burnley's, but a strong display on the practice field should keep Coyle in his corner, meaning a contract and opportunities will follow."
9,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4816200/americans-abroad-face-critical-months,Americans abroad face a critical few months,"The change in the calendar year brings about a heightened sense of anticipation ahead of the World Cup in June. Moves in the January transfer window seem to be made more with an eye toward South Africa than in securing professional stability. Those recovering from injury face a race against time to get from the treatment table to the playing field in time to prepare for June.

Some American players -- and by extension, American fans -- find themselves in a state of anxiety this time of year. South Africa suddenly doesn't seem so far away and the opportunities to make an impression are becoming few and far between.

Maurice Edu, for instance, only recently returned to the field for Rangers after a lengthy spell on the sidelines due to injury. He has limited time to force himself back into Rangers' coach Walter Smith's lineup and show U.S. national team coach Bob Bradley he can be the type of box-to-box midfielder the national team lacks at the moment. Similarly, his Rangers teammate DaMarcus Beasley is in equal need of health and opportunity as he sets out to convince Bradley and American fans that a short memory can be a virtue when considering selection for the national team.

For players like Oguchi Onyewu and Charlie Davies, the countdown to June probably feels more like a race against time and the ground both need to cover to get back to full health seems daunting. Onyewu's prognosis has been more positive. It remains to be seen when and if Davies can return to full fitness.

Perhaps no national team member has a more important decision to make than Stuart Holden. A move from the MLS to Europe so close to the World Cup is a tricky proposition. He can feel confident he's done enough to warrant inclusion in Bradley's June roster, but he'll need regular run from now until then if he's to force himself into Bradley's starting 11. He has a lot at stake and a move overseas right now is certainly ambitious. But he also seems to have plenty of good options, and at 24 years old and entering the prime of his career, that's not a bad dilemma to have.

Speaking of options, they seem to be what Eddie Johnson and Freddy Adu are running out of. Their loan to Greek club Aris feels more like an exile, a move motivated more by desperation than an attempt to secure their long-term future. But the past couple of years have treated neither player kindly and a guarantee of regular minutes might be the best they can hope for. As it stands, they're likely on the outside looking in on Bradley's World Cup roster.

While these are some of the many developing subplots to keep an eye on from here to June, perhaps the most intriguing storyline is not one involving fringe players looking for a late push or established players on the move. It involves players so obviously entrenched in the national team side you might forget that they too are facing pivotal moments in their careers.

I'm talking of course about Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey. I exclude Tim Howard from this discussion because it's rather implausible to think he's going to suffer a major dip in form in the next six months. He offers the best quality a goalkeeper can provide: an excellence that's so consistent it borders on boring.

If recent performances are any indication, Dempsey and Donovan are primed to make major strides in the coming months. Donovan was impressive in his Everton debut, assisting on the opening goal and causing fits for Arsenal's left back Armand Traore in a 2-2 draw. That he was included in the starting 11 with so little preparation time against a team that had previously beaten Everton 6-1 shows the confidence Everton coach David Moyes has in Donovan's ability.

Dempsey, meanwhile, has not only cemented himself in Fulham's starting 11, he's become perhaps its most important player. Tied with Bobby Zamora as the team's leading scorer with six goals, he's at the forefront of much of Fulham's attacking movement. And if his wonder goal against Stoke is any indication, he's developing an appetite for goals that might cause Bradley to rethink his role in the national team side.

In the coming months, it's natural to focus on how the bottom of the national team side will shape up and what players will play their way into a trip to South Africa. But we should keep in mind that it's still the cream of the crop that will determine the U.S. team's fortunes in June. The two best American players are playing and performing well for competitive English sides. The strides they make and the progress they bring to South Africa could be the most interesting development for the national team in the months leading up the World Cup."
10,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4808058/count/11/backe-future-new-york,Backe for the future in New York,"Leave it to New York to surprise us all. Of the names mentioned as a potential head coach of the Red Bulls, that of Hans Backe was one that garnered little (or no) attention. The 57-year-old Swede, who recently quit as manager of Notts County after just seven weeks, has been charged with turning around the fortunes of a franchise that, save for an unlikely run to the MLS Cup in 2008, has consistently flattered to deceive.

While the hire of Backe was New York's most stunning move of the week, the retention of Richie Williams was the shrewdest. Williams impressed as interim head coach in the latter part of last season, and his knowledge of MLS will be invaluable to Backe and Erik Soler, the Red Bulls' new general manager.

Meanwhile, Chicago and D.C. United have also finalized their new men in charge. Carlos de los Cobos has reportedly been hired by the Fire, while D.C., having been rejected by its first choice, Caleb Porter, has recruited former Kansas City coach Curt Onalfo.

De los Cobos did a fine job to qualify El Salvador for the final round of CONCACAF qualifying for this year's World Cup but will be well aware that international coaching is vastly different from the day-to-day demands of running a club, especially in the unique world of MLS. The presence of Frank Klopas as Fire technical director will help smooth the transition.

Onalfo, of course, has previous experience as a head coach in the league as well as with D.C. United, where he served as an assistant a decade ago, having previously won championships as a player. His time in Kansas City was mixed, as consecutive playoff appearances were followed by an underachieving start to 2009, which led to his firing last August. Despite that setback, his credentials, which include a keen eye for young talent, remain solid.

All of which means that, with Peter Nowak leading Philadelphia, Preki taking over in Toronto and Peter Vermes having had the ""interim"" part of his title removed in Kansas City, six of the Eastern Conference's eight teams are employing first-year coaches in 2010.

In that company, Robert Warzycha seems like an old hand as he enters his second season with Columbus, not that he has anything on the veteran status of Steve Nicol, who has been in charge of New England since 2002.

CBA agreement looks no closer

As if the challenges facing those new coaches were not hard enough, the uncertainty over the immediate future of MLS makes their lives even less straightforward. As the Jan. 31 deadline for signing a new collective bargaining agreement gets ever closer, the two sides in the discussion continue to be far apart, with the rhetoric from both indicating that neither is set to back down imminently.

Thus, it is a somewhat odd time to be involved with professional soccer in this country. While fans simply hope their teams will be playing in late-March, coaches on scouting trips are unable to offer guarantees about the season ahead to potential signings, which means their targets are harder to secure, especially if they have competing offers that offer greater security.

Meanwhile, spare a thought for the young men headed to Florida this weekend for the annual player combine. With the draft set to take place next Thursday, the next few days could make or break their dreams of a pro career. However, even if they impress and hear their name called in Philadelphia, what happens next?

Usually, rookies would spend the following weeks frantically packing and moving to their new home ahead of the start of preseason in early February. This year, there may not be as great a need to rush.

Good luck, No. 9

Weather permitting, Landon Donovan looks set to make his Everton debut at Arsenal on Saturday. It will be a baptism of fire for the American against one of the Premier League's in-form teams, which has won 14 of the its last 17 home games against the Toffees.

Everton manager David Moyes has had some good things to say about his on-loan recruit this week, and a further sign of that confidence was seen when he handed Donovan the club's No. 9 shirt, worn previously by such Goodison Park idols as Dixie Dean, Tommy Lawton, Joe Royle, Bob Latchford, Graham Sharp and Andy Gray.

More recently, No. 9 was worn by Duncan Ferguson, the uncompromising Scottish forward whose style made him a terrace favorite and inspired this cracking chant:

Duncan is our hero

He wears the number nine

He wears his shirt with pride

He wears it all the time



He wears it in the shower

He wears it on the nest

Duncan is our hero

He is the f------ best!"
11,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4794933/count/11/donovan-begins-everton-adventure,Donovan begins his Everton adventure,"So now that we're in a new year, most of the focus is on the January transfer window in Europe that not only promises to have a huge impact on the way some teams will retool their squads, but also possibly will see various U.S. players heading to and from the States (Stuart Holden to Burnely?).

1. Landon Donovan in England. Donovan arrived on Merseyside on Saturday and was able to watch Everton beat Carlisle 3-1 in the FA Cup. He'll be in training all week and is expected to be available when Everton takes on Arsenal in its next league match. I'm not sure manager David Moyes will throw Donovan in action that early -- there'll be a natural adjustment period he'll need to adapt to the pace of English soccer, and the fact that Donovan isn't in game shape after a five- to six-week layoff. Bear in mind that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger used Andrei Arshavin sparingly in the first four weeks after acquiring him in the '09 January transfer window, citing his layoff in the Russian winter break as the main reason. When Donovan does see the field, what are his prospects for playing time? Well, the good news is, it's not Bayern, which means there aren't a bevy of well-established world-class stars ahead of him in the pecking order.

I see Moyes using Donovan primarily on either the left or right wing to rotate with current incumbents Steven Pienaar and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov. The other possibility is using Donovan in the hole behind the main striker as the primary AM option (Leon Osman has been used there recently). Having said that, since both Pienaar and Bilyaletdinov are comparable talents to Donovan, it's unlikely he'll be able to displace either as the starter from the get-go and will have to earn his minutes as a sub initially. There's also the unlikely option that Moyes could use Donovan as a striker, but I doubt we'll see that unless both Louis Saha and Yakubu are felled by injuries again (always a possibility with that pair). One player Donovan won't be competing with for playing time is Brazilian striker Jo, who, as I said in March '09, is a horrendously overrated player who combines inept finishing with a horrendous attitude, and whose Premier League career looks to be all but over with just six goals to his name. Everton's schedule during Donovan's loan will see the team face virtually all the English powerhouses, so this promises to be an interesting 10 weeks or so. It'll also be funny to see him running around with my name on his shirt

2. U.S. training camp in Carson, Calif. The U.S. team's annual get-together at the Home Depot Center kicks off today. Looking at the list of players that coach Bob Bradley has called up, there are several names that are intriguing. First is New England's Kevin Alston, who has the look of a future national team right back, and along with Marvell Wynne (assuming Wynne continues his technical development) will push hard for a starting berth in the next few years. Should either Alston or Wynne emerge, one would then have the option of developing Jonathan Spector at center back (still his best position in my opinion) or seeing if he can play left back at the international level to fill the void there. Other camp prospects I'd be keen to take a look at would be Alejandro Bedoya and Houston's Geoff Cameron, who I think could play in Europe as a center back and is easily the winner of the No One Thought He'd Ever Be Quite This Good award, if such an award existed.

3. The Next Prodigy. I'm also of the opinion that sometime in the next eight years, Belgium will reemerge as a powerhouse on the international scene and recapture the glory of the Enzo Scifo years (what a player). For this to happen, it'll need the right coach who can conquer the divisive cliques and prima-donna attitudes that currently poison the national team setup, but in terms of superb young talent Belgium is literally overflowing. With players of the ilk of Eden Hazard, Moussa Dembele, Steven DeFour, Thomas Vermaelen, Axel Witsel and Sebastien Pocognoli, it's astonishing that the Belgium national team continues to flounder.

You can also add Anderlecht's 16-year-old Romelu Lukaku to the list. When I see Lukaku play, I'm reminded of a conversation I had in Houston at the Free Kick Masters back in 2008. I was standing on the sidelines with Robert Pires, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho and the subject of conversation at the time was Jozy Altidore (who also was present). We were all talking about Jozy's age and trying to convince Ronaldinho and Messi that Jozy was in fact just 18 years old. Ronaldinho kept looking at Altidore's physique up and down, and then laughing in disbelief at the notion. Well, that description applies to Lukaku, except threefold. Lukaku, who already checks in at close to 6-foot-4 with impressive bulk and speed, is a sheer stud of a specimen who is already scoring with abandon in the Belgian league, and has drawn the interest of Chelsea (rumored to have already had a $18 million bid rejected). He's unlikely to move anywhere until he's at least 18, though since he's still attending high school during the week at his parents' insistence (school kid by day, striker by weekend, it seems).

4. The Former Prodigy. With Freddy Adu's club career once again in limbo (he's now back with Benfica) after failing to impress at Belenses, it's all but certain that Adu'll miss out on South Africa. There's next to no chance he'll get any playing time at Benfica, where Argentine winger Angel Di Maria is approaching serious stardom and attracting $35 million bids. The irony, of course, is that Di Maria was signed at the same time as Adu and flourished while Adu has barely gotten on the field. The rumor mill has Greek club Aris interested (there have also been dubious rumors of Hull, but the English Premiership would be a terrible move for Adu) and even some MLS clubs thinking of bringing him back to the States. (Considering the way he failed to light up the league last time, I doubt there's a lot of interest in him from MLS either.) Of course, Adu is still young and he can still turn it around if he gets in the right situation with the right coach, but in terms of his 2010 World Cup hopes, I think we can assume those are just a pipe dream at this point.

Also, don't forget to check out goalkeeper Brad Guzan in the Carling Cup semifinal first leg on Tuesday when Aston Villa takes on Blackburn. You can watch the game live (not to mention for free) on ESPN360.com at 3 p.m. ET.

On a last note, I've gotten various e-mails asking about the status of the U.S. Soccer podcast show that we put out on Fridays. As it stands, it's temporarily on hiatus until the 2010 MLS season kicks off, though we might do the occasional one prior to that where warranted."
12,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4790445/count/11/three-things-watch-2010,Three things to watch for in 2010,"As I sit here at the start of a new year, here are a few questions to ponder as we watch the year unfold:

Will Lionel Messi continue to dominate?

In 2009, Argentina's best player asserted himself as the world's best, leading Barcelona to domestic, European and world titles while being named the FIFA World Player of the Year. The recognition bestowed upon Messi this year was well-deserved, almost overdue. In two previous years, he had finished second in the Player of the Year voting, first to Kaka in 2007 and then to Cristiano Ronaldo in 2008.

But with the World Player of the Year award now in Messi's back pocket, there will be a lot of pressure on the 22-year-old to carry over the brilliance of 2009 into 2010, particularly at the World Cup. Not an easy task. Just ask former Messi teammate Ronaldinho, who after winning the award at the end of 2005, was nearly invisible at the 2006 World Cup. With the ever-volatile Diego Maradona managing a team that looked shaky at best in qualifying games, Messi will have to be at his best in 2010 if Argentina is to lift its first World Cup since 1986.

Will Real Madrid earn an immediate return on their investment?

While Barcelona was the unmatched on-field protagonist of 2009, no team made bigger off-field news than archrivals Real Madrid. A summer spending spree that brought in Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema kept Madrid in the headlines throughout the summer months, and halfway through this La Liga season, it looks like money well spent.

However, there have been some bumps in the road for the Galacticos 2.0. Cristiano Ronaldo's extended absence from the lineup resulted in some shaky performances from Madrid throughout October and November. But since its 1-0 loss to Barcelona (a game in which Ronaldo made his league return) Madrid has turned up its play. And despite losing to Barca in the first Classico of the season, Madrid's performance in the match demonstrated that the gap in quality between the two sides has greatly diminished. Should this Madrid side continue to jell in 2010, the return leg of El Classico could yield a very different result and, perhaps, a new Spanish champion.

Are Manchester United for real?

Now to the English league. It was a roller-coaster year for Manchester United. The Red Devils looked like they were well on their way to world domination this past spring as they eyed their second consecutive European Double (domestic league and Champions League titles). By early May, United had wrapped up their 18th English title, but a loss to Barcelona in the Champions League final stripped Alex Ferguson's men of their aura of invincibility. A few weeks after this defeat, United suffered another blow at the hands of a Spanish side, as Cristiano Ronaldo departed the club for Real Madrid.

By the start of the 2009-10 Premier League season this August, the team had gone from the undisputed best in the world to what many felt was a team that would struggle to defend its league title. An early-season loss to Burnley gave credence to these doubts in United. Yet, despite the loss of Ronaldo and a plethora of injuries to its back line, the club currently finds itself second in the table, two points behind league-leader Chelsea. But the success of this season has not garnered them much respect from the soccer world. Recently, both Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho have openly questioned United's overall quality, not an unfair questioning given United's inconsistent play time and again this season. Will Alex Ferguson's men continue to challenge for the Premier League in 2010? Hard to tell, but it's difficult not to admire their effort thus far.

I hope you all enjoy a happy and healthy new year."
13,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4775048/count/11/is-there-problem-jozy-altidore,Is there a problem with Jozy Altidore?,"As he sat on the bench watching his Hull side claw back into a game against Bolton that seemed lost on Tuesday, I wonder what was going through the mind of Jozy Altidore. Substituted after 54 minutes, the 20-year-old no doubt was cheered by the Tigers' comeback but likely was frustrated that he played no part in it.

There are conflicting current consensuses regarding Altidore. A positive one is that the 20-year-old is developing as an all-around player while leading the line for one of the worst teams in the Premier League; his struggles in front of goal are understandable given the lack of service he is getting from a midfield that, without the injured Jimmy Bullard and the out-of-favor Geovanni, struggles for creative inspiration.

The alternative, less complimentary view: Altidore is cutting an increasingly forlorn figure as he fails to make the most of the opportunity he has to play in one of the best leagues in the world, and that 15 games in England's top flight is too long without a goal for a player of his ability.

Few players in the soccer world are beyond criticism, so in that respect a midseason report card that reads ""could do better"" is a fair assessment of Altidore. However, claims that he isn't consistently putting in the work necessary to succeed are an unfair slight. First and foremost, that Altidore continues to play -- of Hull's strikers, only Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink has featured in as many games -- is an endorsement that the team's coaches are satisfied with what they have seen in matches and on the training field. And a poor attitude isn't something I've ever heard associated with Altidore.

Furthermore, the players around Altidore also have a bearing on his fortunes. Against Bolton, for example, could he have achieved more alongside Vennegoor of Hesselink? Although his legs are slowing down, Vennegoor of Hesselink remains an intelligent player with whom it would be easier to form a partnership than, say, Craig Fagan, whose game is based more on hustle and hard work.

Meanwhile, as they chased the game, Hull threw more caution to the wind in midfield, where the creative minds of Nick Barmby and Geovanni helped inspire a comeback while playing in positions vacated by the more workmanlike Richard Garcia and Seyi Olofinjana. From Altidore's point of view, I think I know with which duo he'd prefer to play.

Of all the jobs that exist in the Premier League, playing up front for Hull is one of the toughest, especially for an inexperienced player with almost no previous experience playing top-flight soccer. This isn't to say Altidore couldn't have made a stronger impression -- zero goals in 15 games, with just three of 18 shots on target, is a disappointing return. But with continued application and hard graft, his current travails will be good for Altidore in the long run.

The learning curve might be steep, but that Altidore remains on it is a positive in itself. Consider the alternatives. Had he stayed at Villarreal, would he start ahead of Giuseppe Rossi, Joseba Llorente or Nilmar? It's unlikely he'd get much more than a cameo here and there, which, in a World Cup year, would be unthinkable for U.S. fans.

Jon competes well versus Lennon

A few weeks after Tim Howard struck a blow for the U.S. by saving a penalty from England's Jermain Defoe, Jonathan Spector was given a chance to impress against another member of Fabio Capello's likely World Cup squad when he came up against Aaron Lennon on Monday.

Spector entered the game against Tottenham as a 19th-minute substitute for Herita Ilunga in the first half, by which time Lennon had already terrorized the West Ham backline on more than one occasion, most notably when he created a goal for Luka Modric. The winger, who had beaten Spector to net the winning goal in the teams' previous meeting in August, would continue to threaten all afternoon. But to the American's credit, he wasn't again the consistent threat he had been during the game's first quarter.

Of course, Spurs won the game comfortably, a result that damaged West Ham's hopes of staying in the Premier League. However, on a day of few positives for Hammers fans, supporters of the U.S. were cheered by the defensive display of one their nation's left-back candidates against the man likeliest to start on the right of England's midfield when the two sides meet in Rustenburg on June 12. Unable to match Lennon's pace, Spector opted to stand off and, by avoiding too many rash challenges, was able to contain his man.

After starting against Manchester United earlier this month, Spector had failed to get off the bench in each of the next four games. Ilunga might be back sooner than first feared, so chances to impress might continue to be hard to come by for the Illinois native. However, when his name was called at White Hart Lane, at least he was able to restore some confidence, which could come in handy this summer in South Africa.

A thing that made me go hmmm â¦

As we move from one year into the next, it's time to make some predictions. A few thoughts on what we might see in 2010, starting with some World Cup forecasts:

â¢ It's hardly a surprise pick, but I'm going for Spain to win it all; the Spanish reserves would beat most country's first teams. As for the U.S., I think Bob Bradley's men will finish second in Group C, eventually bowing out after pushing Germany hard in the second round. Beyond that, I think Mexico could do well, as could Paraguay. And Nigeria has what it takes to be the most successful of the African teams.

â¢ Domestically, Los Angeles is my team to beat in MLS. Philadelphia could emulate Seattle and reach the playoffs in its first year. I also think New York could be an interesting team to watch. The Red Bulls will want to make a splash in their new stadium, which means there could be a big name or two on the way to The Big Apple."

Around the time MLS was patting itself on the back for securing the services of Landon Donovan for four-year extension, less progress was being made toward ensuring that the Los Angeles skipper will actually kick a ball in competitive anger next season. Six weeks from the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement, a new deal continues to look some way off.

Kasey Keller had some interesting things to say regarding the CBA in his blog last week, the most pertinent of which was his acknowledgment that a player lockout looks increasingly likely to begin on Feb. 1, around the time preseason training is getting underway.

Given the modest salaries earned by all but a select few in MLS, the players' insistence on fighting their corner is both understandable and laudable, not just from their personal points of view but on behalf of future generations of professionals. However, how much power do they have? Their cause certainly took a hit when FIFA -- under whose guidelines (free agency, guaranteed contracts etc.) they would like to operate more closely -- opted not to become directly involved in the process.

So MLS holds most of the cards in this battle and, to be honest, their stance is understandable. For example, the risks of awarding guaranteed contracts within the confines of a salary cap are clear. Meanwhile, according to a September 2008 report by Forbes, although the financial footing of the league is better at the end of the decade than it was at its beginning, overall it continues to run at a loss.

However, the league must be careful to ensure it strikes a balance between prudent growth and alienating its employees. As Keller himself noted, ""This isn't a negotiation for a bunch of players wanting 8 million a year instead of 7 million a year."" In the wake of Donovan being awarded a contract, which, reports suggest, is worth $9m, should the league fail take care of the other 99.99 percent of its players to their satisfaction, little will be done to enhance the state and reputation of soccer in this country.

As another veteran goalkeeper, Pat Onstad, put it: ""I don't think any work stoppage has ever been beneficial.""

What does DC do now?

Those associated with DC United might be among those who would be less upset than most with a lockout, given the way the club's search for a new coach is going. After Caleb Porter rejected United's overtures, instead opting to stay at Akron, John Spencer also politely refused the chance to interview for the vacant post at RFK Stadium. The speculation is that the Scot is at the top of a shortlist to lead Portland in its first MLS season.

So where does DC turn next? Curt Onalfo and Richie Williams are names that have been linked, and either one would represent a safe choice, given the knowledge and experience of the league each has. However, despite their obvious credentials and the fact that both have been available for some time, that neither has been offered the job to date suggests to me that Onalfo and Williams will be overlooked for the position. The search for a leader goes on in the nation's capital.

Things that made me go hmmm

Bob Bradley has named a 30-man squad for January's training camp in California, which concludes on the 23rd of the month with a friendly against Honduras. The party, which features 15 players who won at least one cap in 2009 and nine who are yet to make a national team appearance, contains a number of intriguing names, including:

Geoff Cameron: Could he be a contender for a World Cup squad spot? Definitely, if he continues to impress in the coming months.

Robbie Findley: Another that needs to kick on from his late 2009 form. If he does and Charlie Davies does not get fit in time, he has a chance.

Omar Gonzalez: Can the Defender of the Year take the next step in his development? Will benefit from specialized coaching.

Kevin Alston: Perhaps more of a candidate for Brazil than South Africa but has the raw materials to develop into an accomplished two-way fullback.

Alejandro Bedoya: Davies' teammate at Boston College, he plays in Sweden and was one of the more surprising inclusions."
15,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4756805/count/11/david-beckham-feature-ac-milan-manchester-united,David Beckham shouldn't feature for AC Milan against Manchester United,"The knockout stage of the Champions League is set, and outside of the much-awaited Mourinho-Ancelotti exchanges, the biggest storyline coming out of the draw seems to be David Beckham's return to Old Trafford as a member of AC Milan.

Now, I understand why this storyline would draw so much interest from fans and the media. After all, Manchester United is where Beckham, over the course of a decade, became Beckham. But we're less than 24 hours into the genesis of this homecoming story, and I'm already tired of hearing about it. Particularly because I don't think Beckham will (or should) play a major role for Milan in either leg of its opening-round battle against United.

After an absolutely atrocious beginning to its season, the Italian side finally came together in a late-October victory against Real Madrid. It was during this match that the Milan lineup clicked, with Pato and Marco Borriello topping an attack supported by a midfield made up of Andrea Pirlo, Massimo Ambrosini, Clarence Seedorf and Ronaldinho. In the aftermath of the Madrid victory, this is the group that has given Milan the best chance at winning. So why would Leonardo mess with it?

Milan has a good thing going right now, and there just doesn't seem to be a natural place for Beckham in the lineup. Ronaldinho has developed into a critical link between the midfield and forwards. Pirlo remains the deeper-lying architect of the bunch. Ambrosini brings the muscle. And Seedorf injects much-needed speed and creativity into the group. Attempt to push Beckham into this lineup and it could cause major issues.

So I expect Beckham's homecoming will turn out to be somewhat anticlimactic, given my assumption that it will likely involve him sitting on the bench, or at least it should. But the two English-Italian showdowns (Chelsea versus Inter being the other) he'll witness from this vantage point do pique my interest, since they will tell us a lot about the quality gap between the Premier League and Serie A.

It was only two years ago that Premier League teams asserted their world dominance with an all-English final and a systematic destruction of Serie A opposition along the way. In the first knockout round of the 2007-08 tournament, Arsenal ran Milan into the ground, while Liverpool comfortably dismissed Inter. In the quarterfinals, Manchester United made quick work of Roma. Three England-Italian showdowns yielded three English victories, but even more damning for Serie A were the zero goals scored by Italian teams in those matchups.

But back to the present. As things stand right now, the top two teams in England are going to face the top two teams in Italy. And while I expect Chelsea to take care of Inter -- Chelsea is too talented and Inter too gutless ( in Europe) for me to make any other pick -- I can't help feeling that a healthy Milan will pull off a minor upset of Manchester United. Such a victory would not only make Milan a relevant European power again, it would also help restore some of the respect Serie A lost two years ago.

My belief in a Milan upset is partly based on the club's recent history of success against United, but also the quality and shape of its midfield, which I believe will be able to control possession. This is, of course, subject to change should the middle of the Milan lineup undergo any unexpected Beckham-related changes."
16,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4750951/count/11/should-stuart-holden-stay-houston-mls-go,"Should Stuart Holden stay with Houston and MLS, or should he go?","While one certain aspirant for the U.S. World Cup squad -- Landon Donovan -- is set to join Everton on loan, the next move in the career of another player with hopes to be on the plane to South Africa is less clear-cut.

Stuart Holden is being courted by a number of European clubs, including Rangers and Aberdeen in Scotland, the land of his birth. However, MLS is fighting hard to retain him, with reports suggesting that Holden, 24, has been offered a new deal by the league that would increase his current salary tenfold.

Holden said he is torn between heading to Europe and staying in MLS to help the league grow. His anxiety is understandable, especially if the best offers are from Scotland. The standard of play in its Premier League is good but not great, with even Rangers and Celtic having regressed in recent times. On the flip side, if an Auld Firm move is in the cards, the opportunity to play European football every year is an attraction.

Meanwhile, it isn't hard to see why MLS is so keen to keep Holden. Aside from his obvious talents on the pitch, he has been a prolific contributor to charitable causes in the Houston community and could be a highly marketable player. Signing him to a long-term deal would help establish Holden as one of the faces of the sport in this country for years to come.

From a soccer point of view, the time is right for Holden -- who spent time at Sunderland before joining Houston -- to move back to Europe. His reluctance to commit indicates he may be waiting for other offers, but sooner or later I expect him to make the jump across the Atlantic.

Bradley hits form in Germany

Holden's international teammate, Michael Bradley, is in a rich vein of form for Borussia Monchengladbach -- a welcome return to his best for the midfielder who struggled to earn playing time in the Bundesliga in the early part of the season. Bradley has started nine straight games and, having registered an assist a week earlier versus Bayern Munich, got back on the goal trail in Saturday's win against Hannover when he rattled home a 20-yard effort.

Monchengladbach has won four of its last six and currently sits 11th in Germany's top flight, a league that has yet to see Jermaine Jones in action this season. However, the good news is that the would-be U.S. international recently returned to training with Schalke 04, as did Maurice Edu with Rangers. Competition for spots in the national team's midfield appears set to heat up at just the right time.

Well-played, forgotten man

Another man who may force his way back into U.S. coach Bob Bradley's thoughts is DaMarcus Beasley, who has taken advantage of recent opportunities to impress at Rangers by logging a goal and three assists in his last three Scottish Premier League games.

It has been speculated that the initial reason for Beasley's recall to the Gers side was to showcase him to potential buyers, but his recent production appears to have convinced Rangers coach Walter Smith -- who said of Beasley on Wednesday, ""There's no reason for him to move"" -- that he is worth hanging on to.

Whatever the motives, the important thing from a national-team perspective is that Beasley is playing. He may have fallen out of favor on the U.S. squad in recent times, but a fit and firing Beasley offers a naturally left-footed option that Bradley certainly could use.

A thing that made me go hmmm ...

The U.S.'s pre-World Cup schedule continued to take shape this week as friendlies against Honduras and the Netherlands were announced for Jan. 23 and March 3, respectively. Furthermore, if published reports are accurate, a game against Northern Ireland could be added in May.

The proposed fixture list represents a solid group of tests that will help Bradley's side prepare for its campaign in South Africa. More games are likely to be added to the schedule, with an opponent from Africa the most obvious pressing need.

The Honduras game likely will provide a number of MLS players on the fringes of the first-choice squad the chance to impress. Those who do shine figure to be retained for the visit to Amsterdam, which will pit the U.S. against the first European country to qualify for the World Cup. Meanwhile, although Northern Ireland hasn't reached a major tournament since 1986, it impressed in qualifying, finishing fourth in a group that included Slovenia, the Americans' second opponent next summer.

Another thing that made me go hmmm ...

From the Twitter account of Henry Winter, an excellent football writer for The Telegraph in England:

Even if Becks leaves MLS for good, it looks like Thierry Henry will keep up the star-dust count, heading to New York after the World Cup.

The Henry-to-Red Bulls rumors aren't new, and this nugget of information will only add to the speculation. Perhaps a more pertinent question might be: Who will be Henry's coach if and when he arrives in The Big Apple? Whoever it is will be rubbing his hands together at the prospect of an Henry-Angel forward line."
17,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4744894/count/11/donovan-prosper-everton,Donovan to prosper at Everton?,"According to reports, a short-term loan deal that would send Landon Donovan to Everton could be completed soon. For its part, Los Angeles has been predictably coy in responding to reports that this season's MLS MVP was negotiating a move to join the struggling Premier League side. But Everton manager David Moyes indicated the two sides are trying to finalize a deal that reportedly would bring Donovan to England at the start of the January transfer window until the end of March, when he would return to the Galaxy for the start of the MLS season.

Will the latest incarnation of rent-a-Donovan result in another disappointing European adventure for the U.S. national team star? Not likely. The opportunity with Everton presents Donovan with something he didn't have at Bayern Munich last summer: a chance to succeed. Last year's loan deal always seemed doomed to fail and it was through no fault of Donovan's. Rare is the player that can show up and walk into a side like Bayern Munich, especially with so little time to make an impression.

Everton presents a much more favorable scenario. Mired in a miserable start to its Premier League campaign, the team is desperate for a spark. While shoring up the back line may seem like the greater need, the team also lacks creativity, industry, versatility, pace and, most importantly, goals. Mikel Arteta, the team's creative influence, has been out with injury. When healthy, Ayegbeni Yakubu and Louis Saha can form a dangerous strike duo, but injuries have made their partnership largely unreliable. And Jo is the rarest of Brazilian strikers in that he doesn't score goals.

Simply put, Everton could use a player like Donovan. He doesn't excel in any one of the areas of the aforementioned players. But as U.S. and Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard intimated in comments on Everton's Web site, Donovan does each of them well enough to be an asset for any team. The fact that he's comfortable playing in a variety of positions in the midfield and up front makes him a useful option in the Premier League. Of course, the million-dollar question always lingering over his head is if he can provide that quality at the highest level. Despite the brevity of his proposed stay, it's likely we'll find out if and when he suits up for Everton.

Joining a team sitting in 15th place, dangerously close to relegation, doesn't seem like a dream scenario. But let's not forget that Everton was the last side to break up the proverbial ""Big Four"" in England when it finished in fourth place ahead of Liverpool in 2004-05. And with Yakubu (Nigeria), Joseph Yobo (Nigeria), Tim Cahill (Australia), Steven Pienaar (South Africa) and Howard, you've got a team with substantial World Cup representation, so it's not as though the cupboard is bare. In its last two games, Everton drew 3-3 with Chelsea and 2-2 with Tottenham. So while a European place might now be asking a bit much, this team still has enough quality to make things interesting in the second half of the Premier League season.

And the real winner in this deal is the U.S. national team. There's been a slight trend in recent years with more national team players entering the World Cup with European experience. Consider that in the five games the U.S. played in the 2002 World Cup, 12 MLS-based players were on the 23-man roster. As many as six and no fewer than four MLS players featured in the starting 11 in each of those games in South Korea/Japan.

Eleven MLS players traveled to the 2006 World Cup in Germany -- three started in a loss to the Czech Republic, four in a tie with Italy, and three in a loss to Ghana. One of those MLS players, Clint Dempsey, left for England shortly afterward. And while it may have taken longer than many American fans would have hoped, Landon Donovan appears to be set to follow.

Perhaps the numbers are too small to be taken seriously, but I can't help but think the trend toward national team players entering the World Cup with European experience is increasing, however slowly. It's still way too early to know how U.S. coach Bob Bradley will adjust to the injury losses of Charlie Davies and Oguchi Onyewu, but it wasn't long ago that a starting 11 made entirely of European-based players seemed possible, if not likely. In fact, it's easy to imagine a scenario, especially if Stuart Holden and Ricardo Clark venture overseas, in which Bob Bradley arrives in South Africa with only a handful of MLS-based players on his 23-man roster.

American fans have long seen team success at the international level and the migration of young players to Europe as being intertwined. Which brings us back to Donovan. Fair or not, he's the standard for which the national team is judged. And the reality is, the greatest talent America has to offer doesn't play against the greatest talent the world has to offer. That's always been a source of frustration for American fans. Clint Dempsey has made himself one of the most important players on a pretty good Premier League team. I'm one of the biggest Dempsey fans, but he's not better than Donovan.

Perhaps now we'll get to see how Donovan fares in arguably the greatest league in the world. He carries higher expectations than any other American player. The easy answer for this is that it's because he's the best we have to offer and American fans would like some confirmation on the world stage of what we see on the national team. Is that so much to ask? Maybe. But we can afford to be demanding. We're entering a World Cup year, after all."
18,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4734137/count/11/us-opener-england-not-ideal,U.S. opener against England not ideal,"A week has passed since the World Cup draw in South Africa, but the positive buzz surrounding the U.S. national team's inclusion in Group C still lingers. The U.S. undoubtedly did very well for itself, having drawn two very beatable opponents in Algeria and Slovenia to go along with group power England. This is a much better situation than 2006, when the Yanks had to square off against a high-quality Czech Republic squad, eventual world champion Italy and a top-tier African team in Ghana.

OK, here comes the but ...

Despite having a great chance to advance out of the group, I can't help but think the U.S. is not in an ideal situation as far as the order in which it must play its games. My reservations are based largely on one fact: The Yanks open the 2010 tournament against England.

""We want England. We want England."" This was the refrain at Nevada Smith's in the moments leading up to the draw. Some of this bravado was likely brought on in part by the excitement of the day mixed with a cocktail or two. Well, ask and you shall receive; and frankly, I don't get why anyone would ask.

This is not meant to be a knock against the U.S.; rather, it's an expression of how highly I rate England under manager Fabio Capello. The no-nonsense Italian coach has seemingly figured out the Gerrard-Lampard question, has Wayne Rooney on the verge of a goal-scoring explosion in South Africa and has the rest of the England squad finally playing with a desire and effort that matches the team's high level of talent. Outside of Brazil and Spain, there is no better team in the world right now.

These are a few of the reasons why I just don't see the U.S. walking away from its opening game against England with any points. Not this time, not with Capello at the helm, a man who mixes the tactical brilliance of Bill Belichick with an ability to manage egos on a par with Joe Torre. Does anyone really think he won't have his team motivated and ready to take three points in its opening game?

And therein lie my reservations for the U.S. The problem with the World Cup is that a four-year buildup comes down to three games in the opening round of the tournament. Three measly games. With the stakes this high, and the margin for error so small, it helps to take three points, or at least one, in your opening game.

If the U.S. falls to England in the opener, it would present a likely must-win match for the Yanks four days later against Slovenia. A game the U.S. can handle, but a pressure game nonetheless. And it's not like Slovenia is a complete pushover, just ask the Russians.

Now, with that stated, I think the U.S. can, should and will advance out of Group C. They are the second-most talented team in the group. But it won't be a cakewalk and fans of the Yanks may be sweating a little more than expected in the days between the England and Slovenia games."
19,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4726179/count/11/all-us-england,It's all about the U.S. and England,"The buildup to the World Cup is traditionally a time for unbridled optimism, as fans dream of what their nation may be capable on foreign fields in the months to come. Nowhere is this more the case than in England.

For yours truly, the 2010 group stage draw coincided with a holiday ""back home"" to England, which in a soccer sense, has re-established itself as a force to be reckoned with by cruising through qualifying, after Fabio Capello transformed the ramshackle outfit that failed to reach the 2008 European Championships.

Although the majority in England has no doubt that England will easily win Group C -- following the draw, one bookmaker saw sufficient patriotic action to promote Fabio Capello's side to second favorite, ahead of Brazil and behind only Spain -- the U.S. is, nevertheless, seen as its most testing opponent.

It is reflective of the increased respect that exists for the American game in the land of the Premier League, even if it may be dangerous to overlook Algeria, which beat the African champions, Egypt, to qualify. To this observer, Group C's ""other half"" has the ability to make the section tighter than some have predicted.

But enough about all that, for England versus the U.S. is where it's going to be at for the next six months. The English press began the hype immediately and ramped it up further on Sunday, following Tim Howard's penalty-saving heroics against Jermain Defoe. A day later, the back-page headline in London's Metro newspaper read ""USA 1 England 0.""

The virtues of Clint Dempsey were extolled in the media all weekend, especially in light of his excellent recent form, while reports have appeared linking Landon Donovan, who is currently best known in England for his fallout with David Beckham, with a January loan move to Everton.

Meanwhile, it's not just on the field that America and England appear set to clash next year. The Daily Mirror reported on Tuesday that the United States may try to base itself in Rustenburg at a state-of-the-art training complex originally earmarked by England as a possible base. Let the fun before the game begin.

England (and the U.S.) expectations

Although much is always demanded of England, in light of its favorable draw, it will be interesting to see how the U.S. deals with the expectation that will be placed upon it. With no ""Group of Death"" tag to hide behind and following a year in which its Confederations Cup run has seen it grab the wider world's attention, gone is the underdog moniker worn by the United States, to mixed effect, in previous World Cups. Can it deal with the pressure?

When it comes to heroic failure, the U.S. and England have become almost kindred spirits in recent World Cups. In 2002, Bruce Arena's side was hard done by when an unseen German hand denied Gregg Berhalter's goal-bound effort. The phantom foul called on Carlos Bocanegra against Ghana in Nuremberg four years later was another heartbreaking moment.

No team, though, has found a greater variety of ways to be knocked out of World Cups than England. Since winning the tournament in 1966, success-starved fans of the Three Lions have contended with the ""Hand of God,"" as well as questionable red cards, not to mention disallowed goals and, last but not certainly least, a litany of fluffed penalties.

For the sake of the long-suffering fans of both nations, perhaps it is just as well that England and the U.S. are to meet in a group stage match!

A thing that made me go hmmm

It's a shame that one of the group stage's most mouth-watering games will be played in the World Cup's smallest venue. Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg has a capacity of just 42,000 and could likely be sold out three or four times over, such will be the demand for tickets from England and U.S. fans.

Luck of the draw dictated where teams would meet but, given that the U.S.'s games against Slovenia and Algeria, which will be played in venues of 62,567 (Johannesburg) and 51,760 (Pretoria) capacities, it's a shame that the fortune it enjoyed with the drawing of its opponents did not extend to the venues at which it will play them."
20,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4716667/count/21/us-clear-path-world-cup-group-stage,U.S. has a clear path out of the World Cup group stage,"I've never watched a World Cup draw before. To be honest, I never really considered it. What was there to see? You were assured of a couple of cupcake groups and a ""group of death."" If you were a United States fan, it was a futile exercise in crossing your fingers and hoping to avoid the worst-case scenario.

But who knew a lottery could be so exciting? Apparently, a little pomp and circumstance and a whole lot of Charlize Theron could turn a pingpong-ball draw into a red-carpet event. Needless to say, I was hooked, and not just because the stakes were so high for the United States. Once again, circumstances seemed to conspire against the U.S., with more worst-case scenarios in play than favorable ones. But then, the unthinkable happened Lady Luck (or maybe Charlize?) favored the Americans.

I'm loath to predict anything at this stage, with an eternity to go until June. But here are my thoughts on each of the groups and how I see each playing out right now. Picking one team from each group seems easy enough. But there are plenty of groups in which the second qualifying spot seems to be up for grabs among the three remaining teams.

Group A: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay, France

Even from my cubicle in Bristol, Conn., you could feel the oxygen leave the room when Mexico was placed in the same group as South Africa. It was the big chip that everyone was waiting for to fall and seemed to ratchet up the tension as the rest of the selections were made.

But while Mexico must have felt it had dodged a bullet by being placed with South Africa, the good cheer quickly soured upon hearing France's name called. With Uruguay in play as well, the Mexicans suddenly went from having a plum position to staring at one of the most difficult groups in the tournament. It did seem that justice was served after France -- basically a top seed in disguise -- was placed with South Africa.

Prediction: It's a trickier slate than it probably looks on paper for France with three non-European teams, but even if it comes down to needing to beat South Africa in the final group game, you'd have to favor the French to win the group, with Uruguay following in behind them.

Group B: Argentina, Nigeria, South Korea, Greece

Diego Maradona said he's pleased with Argentina's draw. Ostensibly, he should be. But I wonder if these aren't the type of teams that can give Argentina trouble. It didn't respond well to being taken out of its comfort zone during qualifying, and that was against South American teams that the Argentines generally dispose of comfortably.

Nigeria, South Korea and Greece offer a completely mixed bag of athleticism, speed, fitness, organization and dogged defense that will surely frustrate the Argentines. None of the teams aspire to the type of aesthetic Argentina seeks, and they certainly won't delude themselves into thinking that they can match the Argentines in terms of quality. Will Diego & Co. be able to meet the challenge?

Prediction: One of the three will hand Argentina a loss that will be hailed as a monumental upset, but it won't stop the Argentines from winning the group. One thing's certain: The games between Nigeria, South Korea and Greece will be infinitely more interesting from a neutral's perspective. Whichever team draws blood against Argentina is the second to advance to the next round. I'll give the edge to Greece.

Group C: England, United States, Algeria, Slovenia

Much has been made of the United States' good fortune with this draw, and there's not much to add. Slovenia and Algeria were the best-case scenarios for the Americans. Be honest: How many of you were mentally preparing for Portugal's card to be pulled?

As for England, I'm of the mindset -- and apparently in the minority -- that it was one of the most desirable seeded teams the United States could draw, aside from South Africa, of course. Spain, Brazil and Argentina would have been disastrous. Germany and Holland both have such singular styles, and it would be hard to see the Americans forcing them out of their comfort zone. I wouldn't have minded Italy. But I honestly think England gives the Americans the best chance to steal a result out of the seeded teams.

I'm not saying they should be favored to win, and I'm not disputing that England doesn't have more exceptional players at every position. But England's more direct, physical approach actually plays to the Americans' strengths. They struggle with crafty, skillful and deceptive teams. England -- even the new and improved version under Fabio Capello -- is still coming right down Main Street. If the Americans can win enough of the individual battles early and keep the English in front of them, there's no reason they can't steal a draw in the opening game.

Prediction: England takes the group with the United States following in second.

Group D: Germany, Australia, Serbia, Ghana

The group obviously belongs to Germany. The Germans might be down in terms of talent from past years, but it's never been smart to bet against them in a major competition, and it's not wise to start now.

Beyond that, I can't really distinguish who else I like to get out of this group. I'm inclined to lean toward Ghana, who, along with Australia, exceeded expectations in the previous World Cup.

But Serbia will feel that it has a point to prove after its 2006 run. The Serbs weren't as bad as their result in the previous World Cup indicated; they just had the misfortune of being placed in an impossible group.

Prediction: Germany wins, with Serbia following behind.

Group E: Netherlands, Denmark, Japan, Cameroon

The best thing this group has going for it is that Denmark and the Holland open with each other, making the two group favorites force the issue in the opening game instead of navigating through their lesser opponents first. That also means Japan and Cameroon's opening-round game is probably an elimination game, with both needing to grab maximum points to position themselves the rest of the way. Always good fun.

Prediction: Holland wins the group. Cameroon beats Japan in the opener and rides that momentum to the next round.

Group F: Italy, Paraguay, New Zealand, Slovakia

If Italy hasn't clinched a place in the next round by the end of the second game, the Italians will probably be disappointed. That's how pleased they must have been after this draw. It will be interesting to see Marcello Lippi's approach in the early going. Will he be a little more ambitious or favor a more conservative, play-it-safe approach?

Prediction: Italy cruises, with Paraguay following the Italians to the next round.

Group G: Brazil, North Korea, Ivory Coast, Portugal

Pity poor Ivory Coast. I was among those who pegged the Ivoirians to be a breakout team this year, but alas, they find themselves in yet another group of death. All is not lost, however. The inclusion of North Korea essentially makes it a three-team race. Portugal versus Ivory Coast in the opening game figures to be the most important and exciting opener in the tournament.

Prediction: Brazil wins the group, but Ivory Coast beats Portugal in the opening game and uses the points over North Korea to book its ticket to the next round.

Group H: Spain, Switzerland, Honduras, Chile

What is there to say, really? Could Spain win the group fielding a secondary starting 11? Probably.

Prediction: Spain and Switzerland."
21,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4700100/count/21/the-world-awaits-world-cup-draw,The world awaits the World Cup draw,"With a weekend full of heavyweight domestic clashes (Barca-Real, Arsenal-Chelsea, Liverpool-Everton, etc.) over in Europe, I'd normally be tempted to weigh in on it, but since this is officially World Cup draw week, I'm going to talk strictly World Cup.

The draw takes place Friday, and not only can you see it live on our air (12 p.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360.com), but we'll be having a CoverItLive panel for ESPN.com analyzing the draw step-by-step. The panel will comprise everyone's favorite wizard not named Harry Potter in Jimmy Conrad, along with Jeff Carlisle, Leander Schaerlaeckens and myself (Ives Galarcep will also be doing a drive-by panel appearance).

As for the likely group scenarios for the U.S. -- the pots/seeds haven't been officially announced yet, but since FIFA rarely does anything innovative, you can pretty much count on a reprisal of the usual formula for pots.

The first pot will be the eight seeds, while the rest of the draw is divided by confederation, with UEFA teams in their own pot; Africa (CAF) and the remaining South American teams (CONMEBOL) grouped together; and the final and fourth set of teams made up of qualifiers from Oceania, Asia (AFC) and North and Central America (CONCACAF).

The result will be a set that looks as follows:

Pot 1: South Africa, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Germany, Argentina, England, France

Pot 2: Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Switzerland, Greece, Serbia, Denmark, Slovakia

Pot 3: Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Algeria, Paraguay, Chile, Uruguay

Pot 4: Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Australia, New Zealand, United States, Mexico, Honduras

Looking at that list, the ideal draw for the U.S. would probably be France (I'll exclude South Africa, since South Africa is pretty much the dream seed for every team to draw), Slovenia and Algeria. Chances for that to happen and the U.S. to get something like England, Greece and the Ivory Coast instead? Probably pretty high considering the Americans' luck or lack of it when it comes to FIFA draws in general.

As for the actual tournament, 2010 will be the ninth World Cup I've followed -- since the 1978 World Cup, I've seen every match, so I thought I'd share with you what my three favorite matches from that period were:

1. France 3, West Germany 3, 1982 -- Not only my favorite World Cup game ever, but my favorite international match of all time. Two superb teams that played beautiful possession soccer with great skill and technique (the West Germans had underrated flair) and a game that had my two favorite players of all time (France's Jean Tigana and Germany's Pierre Littbarski). The French team of the early to mid-'80s with its dynamic midfield (Platini, Alain Giresse, Tigana and later on Luis Fernandez) routinely carved up opponents with precision and was extremely unlucky to lose this one. Tied at one apiece after regulation, the French looked like sure winners when they went up 3-1 in extra time on two glorious goals. However, the Germans brought on a half-fit Karl Heinz Rummenigge, who would inspire a two-goal comeback and eventual penalty shootout win.

2. Scotland 3, Holland 2, 1978 -- Along with the rest of the U.K. (well, the objective ones anyway), I was one of those who thought that the Scots were a dark horse in '78. Forget the Scottish sides you've seen in the past two decades; back then the Scots were laden with world-class talent like Kenny Dalglish, Willie Johnston, Graeme Souness and Archie Gemmill and entertained genuine hopes of going deep in the tournament. However, it all unraveled horribly with a loss to Peru (led by the genius of Teofilo Cubillas) and Johnston's subsequent suspension for failing a drug test (he took the wrong hay fever remedy). Things didn't get any better when the Scots could only tie Iran 1-1 and relied on an Andranik Eskandarian own goal at that (if the name sounds familiar, it's because he's the father of the Galaxy's Alecko Eskandarian). Heading into its final game, Scotland was given next to no chance against a superb Dutch team, but turned in an epic and unforgettable performance.

3. Denmark 6, Uruguay 1, 1986 -- A master class of attacking football from the maverick Danish side of the mid-'80s, which was one of the greatest offensive sides I've ever seen. That team, containing electric talents such as Michael Laudrup, Soren Lerby and Preben Elkjaer, failed to win anything of note, but on style points alone blew everyone's mind.

Honorable mentions:

Brazil 2, Russia 1, 1982 -- If you ever want to watch an example of what it takes to beat the world's best goalkeeper, then watch Brazil versus Rinat Dasaev in 1982. Trailing 1-0 to the Soviets for much of the game, Brazil pulled the fat out of the fire with two late wonder goals from Socrates and Eder (the latter's goal being one of my favorites of all time).

Germany 1, U.S. 0, 2002 -- This game was notable for a multitude of reasons, and not just the drama. It was where I first saw that the U.S. had truly become a legit footballing nation, and where I was surrounded by European soccer cognoscenti who were similarly gobsmacked. Aside from (mostly) outplaying the Germans and being robbed by that handball call, the game was memorable for the fearlessness and the direct running of then-youthful U.S. speedster Landon Donovan. I remember watching the game from a bar in Hong Kong and being asked by several startled French journalists, ""Who are those guys?""

As an aside, I still think the U.S. starting lineup in '02 was superior to the '06 lineup and the likely lineup the U.S. will field in South Africa next year (although obviously there's far greater depth across the board now).

Anyway, I'd be interested to know what all your favorite (not best) games were, so feel free to post in the comments section below."
22,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4688658/count/21/the-return-nasl,The return of the NASL,"While MLS was preparing for its end-of-season party, a new soccer venture called the North American Soccer League was announcing its formation, following the breakaway of a number of clubs from the United Soccer Leagues. That's right, starting from April 2010, the NASL is back.

Putting aside the decision to name the league after a competition that collapsed as spectacularly as once it flourished, it remains to be seen what impact the NASL will have on the soccer landscape, operating along with USL-1 as a second professional league in the tier below MLS.

One thing is for sure, though. While those behind the NASL have spoken of a desire to pay their ""respect to the players, coaches and leaders, who were pioneers for men's professional soccer in North America,"" Pele is not coming back and nor is Franz Beckenbauer or Johan Cruyff, meaning that only in name is this incarnation reflective of its predecessor.

Not that a lack of glitz and glamour should necessarily be looked upon as a bad thing. The growth of MLS and USL has come about thanks to a pragmatic approach and it is to be hoped that this new kid on the block follows similar methods. Good luck to American soccer's new arrival.

For Real

Congratulations to Real Salt Lake, which became the latest team to prove that, as long as you get into the playoffs, regular season form means absolutely nothing.

Having triumphed just twice away from Rio Tinto between March and October, RSL managed to work out how to win on the road at just the right time, prevailing first in Columbus, followed by Chicago and, finally, Seattle. Jason Kreis deserves all the credit bestowed on him for bringing his team to its peak at just the right time.

Salt Lake had many standouts, with Nick Rimando, Kyle Beckerman and Robbie Findley consistently impressive throughout the playoffs. Meanwhile, it also had its heart-warming stories. Three days short of his 33rd birthday, Clint Mathis played a prominent part in a championship. Also, I defy anyone not to be pleased for Andy Williams, whose career has enjoyed an Indian summer while, in his personal life, he and his family dealt with incredible strain.

As for Los Angeles, it may take a while and be of little consolation but the Galaxy should offset its disappointment with the realization that, 12 months after being the league's laughingstock, it came within a penalty kick of winning MLS Cup. With the league MVP, Rookie and Coach of the Year in its ranks, L.A. is primed for another tilt at a title in 2010.

Expansion draft

While the party goes on in Salt Lake City, in Philadelphia, the league's newest club, selected 10 players Wednesday in the expansion draft.

Setting aside a number of obvious candidates, including Ricardo Clark and Chris Rolfe, who are out of contract with MLS and therefore overlooked, here is who I would have selected instead:

Jon Conway (Chivas) -- One of several decent goalkeepers available, the Pennsylvania native would surely relish the chance to get a career, which has stuttered in recent times, back on track.

Alejandro Moreno (Columbus) -- Offers experience and an eye for goal. Expansion teams often struggle offensively in their debut season and Moreno's know-how would help deal with that problem.

Pat Noonan (Colorado) -- Another veteran in need of a new challenge. His career took a wrong turn after he left New England but, at 29, he has plenty left to offer. He could dovetail well with Moreno.

Brandon Barklage (D.C. United) -- He is inexperienced and is also recovering from a season-ending knee injury. However, reports suggest D.C. would be upset to lose him, which suggests he may be worth a punt by United's former boss.

Matt Besler (Kansas City) -- A potential steal, he missed just two games during his rookie season, during which he played as a fullback and central defender. Peter Vermes may have some explaining to do if he slips away.

Chris Albright (New England) -- Injury wrecked 2009 for him but, having just turned 30, he still has plenty of tread left on the tires. He might have to renegotiate his contract but would likely fancy the opportunity to re-sign with his hometown club.

Chris Klein (Los Angeles) -- The perfect veteran presence, both on and off the field, for a team that has to come together in a hurry. He hardly ever misses a game and can operate anywhere on the right side.

Bobby Convey (San Jose) -- Another Philadelphian whose career needs a push. His move to the Earthquakes did not work out but his talent remains and though he makes a lot of money, a 26-year-old international with top-flight overseas experience is a decent investment.

Tyson Wahl (Seattle) -- An expansion pick last year, Wahl suffered due to the form of others. Nevertheless, he showed enough in 2008 while with Kansas City to suggest he has what it takes. Being left-footed and just 25 are further advantages.

Amado Guevara (Toronto) -- Given his issues with Preki whilst at Chivas, his days in Toronto are almost certainly numbered. He is getting on a bit but, with a World Cup to prepare for, could provide an instant impact."
23,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4685748/count/21/rsl-beckerman-stakes-claim-2010,RSL's Beckerman stakes his claim for 2010,"You'd be hard-pressed to argue with Nick Rimando's selection as the MVP of the MLS Cup. Over the course of two games, he conceded just one goal in four hours and came out on the winning end of two penalty shootouts. That kind of performance in a championship setting surely entitled him to the individual hardware.

Deserving as Rimando is, however, I'd offer another candidate who I think distinguished himself more during Real Salt Lake's remarkable championship run -- a run that really began in the final weeks of the regular season, when it was looking unlikely that RSL would even make the postseason.

I'm talking about midfielder Kyle Beckerman. His contribution to RSL's cause perhaps gets lost among the more highlight-grabbing displays of Rimando and Robbie Findley. But to me, the key to RSL's playoff run was the ability of its central midfield to impose its will on opponents. In each game during the postseason, RSL was determined to establish tempo and rhythm from the back through the midfield, giving its forwards a platform to operate on.

That all starts with Beckerman. Columbus, Chicago and Los Angeles all rely on individual playmakers -- Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Blanco, Landon Donovan and David Beckham -- to spearhead their attacking movements. But while each gravitates toward the middle of the park during games, none is particularly comfortable or effective patrolling this area of the field for 90 minutes. RSL's ability to dominate space and control possession denied those players the room and service they needed to be most dangerous. (I know Schelotto, Donovan and even Blanco didn't exactly disappear against RSL, but they weren't allowed to boss the game the way you would have expected them to.)

It's not all Beckerman, of course. He provides the range of passing, discipline and steel to the midfield, but without Will Johnson and Javier Morales for much of the final -- both were forced out because of illness and injury, respectively -- his responsibilities only increased. Andy Williams and Clint Mathis are no slouches on the ball, but they can longer be relied on to cover a lot of ground in the center of the park for 120 minutes.

The game-tying goal is a good example. The end result was a mixture of reckless abandon and predatory instinct on the part of Robbie Findley. But rewind the play a few frames, and you'll see that the initial movement started entirely with Beckerman. He collected the ball in RSL's defensive third, right in front of Rimando's penalty area, and played the ball out wide to start the move. A couple of passes later, Beckerman's on the ball again, this time in the center of the midfield. He switched the emphasis of play to the left side, linking up with Ned Grabavoy in the attacking third, who found Findley at the edge of the penalty area. The rest, as they say, is history.

It's a less glamorous, but essential function for any successful team. Watching RSL through the playoffs, you notice the ball doesn't go from the defense to the midfield or from the midfield to the attacking third without Beckerman getting a touch. He doesn't always make the home-run pass that creates a goal-scoring opportunity. But he's always within sight of the play and ready to be used as an outlet if his team gets in a jam or to provide cover if possession is lost. It's reminiscent of the way Gilberto Silva played for Arsenal's championship-winning teams, acting as a pivot from the defense to the offense, always in a position to receive the ball and never caught out defensively.

The question has to be asked, then: Has Beckerman played his way back into contention for the U.S. team? If the national team's last two friendlies are any indication, a player with his skill set and style would be a welcome addition. And it's not as if he's a stranger to the senior side, having played well in the Gold Cup and getting periodic call-ups during World Cup qualification. But you have to wonder whether his game translates to the next level. He's not the most athletic player, and to play that position you have to be able to cover a lot of ground, something Ricardo Clark, despite his faults, can do.

Would his lack of speed and athleticism get exposed at the international level? And if it comes down to a situation where Bradley is handing out the final roster spot, do you opt for a reliable player like Beckerman, or higher-risk, higher-reward player like Eddie Johnson or even Freddy Adu? I have a feeling we'll find out from now until next June, as Bradley surely has to give him another opportunity on the senior side in 2010."
24,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4668609/count/21/us-national-team-some-things-work-out,U.S. national team has some things to work out,"International friendlies are frustrating. You never know quite what you're supposed to be rooting for or what your expectations should be. By definition, they're meaningless, so it's hard to spend too much time and energy agonizing over winning or losing.

Ideally, their purpose serves the big picture. It's a snapshot of what a team looks like at a given moment, to be used as a reference point for the future. Indeed, they can be a valuable exercise, if only to provide meaningful competition for players who otherwise don't get many opportunities to play together.

So what does the big picture look like for the United States national team after a two-game European swing through Slovakia and Denmark that ended in 1-0 and 3-1 losses, respectively? Unfortunately, it's a bit blurry.

Even by the most conservative estimate, by now you can nail down 15 seats on the plane to South Africa, which meant these last two games of 2009 served as something of a tryout for the remaining slots on coach Bob Bradley's 23-man roster for the 2010 World Cup. And with the injuries to Oguchi Onyewu and Charlie Davies threatening their World Cup prospects, Bradley is forced to reach deeper into his player pool than he'd probably like in the final months before the competition begins.

Jeff Cunningham is a good example. His blistering goal-scoring streak toward the end of the MLS season forced Bradley to give him a chance. Cunningham is essentially in pay-as-you-play mode, and he can ride his winning hand as long as he keeps scoring goals. Who knows, maybe it'll take him all the way to South Africa. So far, so good, anyway.

But while Cunningham might be playing with house money, it's not just the so-called fringe players who still have something to prove. Ricardo Clark has had the luxury of an unavailable Jermaine Jones and an injured Maurice Edu, the main competition at his position. But his place isn't cemented in the center of that midfield.

Furthermore, though it seems heretical to suggest Jozy Altidore not be included in the starting 11 -- especially without Davies -- how many would object to giving Robbie Findley 90 minutes of leading the line after Altidore's lethargic performance in Denmark? You can be protected by potential for only so long. Maybe he has a better answer for his recent lack of production, but the rest of us are running out of ideas.

Of course, the performances can be excused somewhat by the absence of key players. It's amazing how you take for granted the endeavor and work rate Landon Donovan brings to both the midfield and attacking third.

But that's kind of the point, isn't it? This game -- and this stage of the international season -- isn't so much about the established players as it is about which team can reach deeper into its pocket to pull out a winning combination. Denmark was certainly without many of its big guns. Yet it seemed to the Danes to truly be an open tryout, with eager 20-somethings from the domestic league with a point to prove vying for the few remaining tickets to South Africa. In fact, it must have been an educational evening from the Danes' perspective.

If only it were so from the American point of view. In fairness, it wasn't so much that the performance was bad, just confusing. Inserting Donovan and Clint Dempsey into the lineup goes a long way toward clearing up that picture, but the question marks remain.

To me, Benny Feilhaber distinguished himself more than anyone else against Denmark. But as well as he played, do we know any more about his role in the national side? Is he the main guy in the center of the midfield? Does he stay wide and drift inside as the play develops? Is he there to complement Michael Bradley? Should it be the other way around?

Stuart Holden did nothing to diminish his prospects, either. He showed signs that he's comfortable and capable of being more than a wide player. His is an interesting case to watch moving forward, especially with a likely move overseas in the January transfer window.

The biggest problem with the U.S. performance in Denmark was that it was found guilty of the worst offense at the international level: It was predictable. Without Dempsey or Donovan, there was no fluency or connectivity in any U.S. passing or movement. Scoring three goals right after halftime after being down 1-0 at the break, you might expect that the Danes had a rousing locker-room speech. But you can imagine all that really needed to be said was, ""Pressure their center mids and they'll give the ball away cheaply and their outside backs can be had every time. Do that and we win easily.""

It really seemed that simple for Denmark in the second half, and that's what has to be troubling for Bob Bradley. As I said before, these games have to be viewed in the context that they were played -- with key players absent, injuries and players just on the heels of a long MLS season. And even in failure, these games can be informative.

For his part, Bradley said the things you'd expect him to say. There were bright spots early on, but the game got away from his team in the second half. And while it's not the best bookend to 2009, the year was ultimately a positive one, and these losses don't mean much in the grand scheme of things. But I wonder if he's not more concerned than he lets on about the lack of options he has to turn to.

Three Cheers for Cuauhtemoc

There'll be plenty of words written about the upcoming MLS Cup final in Seattle between the L.A. Galaxy and Real Salt Lake. But my lasting impression from this year's playoffs was that of Cuauhtemoc Blanco during the Chicago Fire's run to the Eastern Conference finals.

Blanco, whose tenure in the MLS came to an end with Chicago's loss to RSL in the Eastern Conference finals, might not be able to match fellow designated player David Beckham in terms of exposure and commercial weight, but that doesn't make his tenure in MLS any less significant. With his return to Mexico to play for Veracruz, it's interesting to compare the two players when you measure their value on the field, independent of T-shirt sales and magazine covers. Each has such a singular quality to his game that is so pleasing to the eye yet impossible to replicate.

But while Beckham's ability to make a ball move in ways that defy the laws of physics can take one's breath away, what Blanco brought to the MLS game is more significant. It's an intuitive quality that's hard to pinpoint but one that is infectious to his teammates and captivating to an audience. His teammates wanted to match his creativity, even if they fell short of his brilliance. He invites players to play a style that should be the standard the MLS is trying to reach.

At first glance, he looks more like a Sunday morning rec-league player than a professional -- and a player you'd pick near the bottom. But despite not possessing the speed to get behind anyone, he can have a defender at his mercy with the ball at his feet. It's guile, it's invention, it's creativity -- whatever you want to call it, it's the kind of quality the MLS doesn't see enough of and will surely miss."
25,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4667033/count/21/la-favorites-showdown-seattle,L.A. favorites for showdown in Seattle,"Los Angeles will begin the MLS Cup as the favorite but there are a number of reasons for Real Salt Lake fans to believe it will be they who are celebrating on Sunday night.

First of all, recent form is on the side of Jason Kreis' team, which tied 2-2 with the Galaxy in May before winning 2-0, at the Home Depot Center, five weeks later. Moreover, as he constructs his game plan for this weekend, RSL's impressive young manager can glean information from his team's performances in those two games that could be very useful.

In both encounters, Los Angeles struggled to contain Salt Lake's pace up front. While Robbie Findley has shone in the postseason, it was the threat of Yura Movsisyan on the break that was a bigger factor when these sides met previously, most notably in the June win when, having been released by a ball from midfield, he beat Gregg Berhalter one-on-one before firing past Donovan Ricketts.

Also interesting to note, when watching these regular season games, was RSL's success from set pieces. Findley scored from a corner in the sides' draw and Nat Borchers found the net at the Home Depot Center after the Galaxy failed to clear a corner properly.

While its opponent will draw comfort from regular season battles, it is likely that L.A. will pay less attention to what has gone before. For example, David Beckham played in neither match, while Landon Donovan also was unavailable for the latter encounter. Given that dearth of creativity, the Galaxy's attacking issues -- just one of their goals came from open play -- are more understandable.

Thus, Los Angeles has more of an element of the unknown and this is another reason I expect this to be a cagey affair if there is no early goal. As it has done throughout its postseason run, Salt Lake will want to play on the counterattack while the Galaxy will seek to avoid exposure at the back to set a platform on which their stars can work.

Neither team lost this season when scoring first but both have shown an ability to recover from falling behind in the playoffs. Given its remarkable run, Salt Lake should have no fear but, like New York last year, I feel that it will fall just short.

With its star duo in tandem, the Los Angeles of the present is a significantly better team than that which turned out against Salt Lake earlier this year. Bruce Arena's side has a little more quality and experience, both on the field and the sideline and, if its backline can get to grips with the opposing strikers, should justify its favorite tag.

A thing that made me go hmmm

What have you made of the playoffs to date? Personally, while there have been some fascinating moments, I have been somewhat disappointed by the lack of a sustained ""wow"" factor.

The most thrilling game was Real Salt Lake's 3-2 comeback win over Columbus (after trailing 2-0), while Chicago's series against New England was one of the more compelling tactical battles. Overall, though, defenses have been on top and the quality of attacking play has been lacking.

Although a paucity of goals does not automatically diminish entertainment, in the case of this postseason, an average to date of 1.9 per game is reflective of a lack of true excitement. Over the past six seasons, only once -- in 2007 when just 16 goals were scored through the first two rounds -- has the total at this stage been below 20.

Furthermore, in only two of the 10 games played this postseason have both teams scored, which makes me think that it is time to tinker with the playoff system. The most obvious change would be to incorporate the away goals rule (where a goal scored on the road counts effectively as double), a move that would encourage road teams especially to adopt a more offensive mindset away from home.

One thing that has been pleasing is the lack of playoff red cards, with just one -- to Seattle's James Riley -- having been shown so far. That number is a happy contrast with the regular season, in which a player was sent off every 2.81 matches. Here's hoping for a continuation of that on Sunday, with an end-to-end game mixed in.

Good luck, young man

By the time you read this, one of the more eagerly awaited national team debuts for some time may already have taken place in Denmark, where Edgar Castillo was expected to don the colors of the U.S. for the first time.

Although Jonathan Bornstein has been improved at left back recently, there is no doubt that the position remains up for grabs and, with plenty of time remaining before a World Cup squad has to be picked, Castillo has a great opportunity to claim a place on the plane to South Africa.

Should Castillo impress, it will be another defensive positive for Bob Bradley after Jonathan Spector did well in a central role against Slovakia. Spector's versatility makes him a shoo-in for South Africa and, with questions remaining over Oguchi Onyewu and Jay DeMerit, continued good form may make the West Ham man a first-choice selection at the back."
26,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4660051/count/21/slovakia-stifles-us-offense,Monday morning musings,"Busy, busy weekend, what with the U.S. team playing, World Cup qualifiers and of course MLS Cup playoffs. Here's what I'm thinking about Monday morning:

1. U.S. versus Slovakia. Of course the disclaimer here is that the U.S. was missing Tim Howard, Oguchi Onyewu, Landon Donovan and Charlie Davies from what would be its ideal lineup. However, the bulk core of the starting lineup was present, and the 1-0 loss to Slovakia highlighted the weaknesses in the U.S. offense, which have long been its lack of creativity and inability to break down solid defenses. Granted, Slovakia won its European qualifying group for the World Cup, but this team has only two high-caliber international players (Martin Skrtel and Marek Hamsik).

As a result, Slovakia typically plays the way we saw it play on Saturday: It defends deep with discipline, cedes possession and looks to attack predominantly on the counter. In short, Slovakia almost always sets up the way the U.S. often does against superior opposition. The result? The U.S. was stifled for virtually the entire game after the Slovaks scored and offered next-to-nothing going forward. And herein lies the problem: The U.S. relies on two things to score most of its goals: set pieces and counterattacking. With both Davies and Donovan in the lineup, the extreme pace the U.S. offers on the counterattack is enough to scare virtually every team. With Davies gone, that breakaway threat is markedly reduced, and defenses can key on Donovan.

Likewise, the U.S. has made a living beating up on the comedic defenses and undersized goalkeepers in the CONCACAF region via set pieces and high balls. That's far more difficult to do against European defenses. My point is the U.S. still needs to prove it can score against a quality foe when it trails and when it needs to bring the game to the opposition. We all know the current U.S. recipe for success against top-tier sides. It basically involves defending deep and hoping to snatch a goal on a set piece or counterattack. If the U.S. takes the lead, it defends even deeper and continues to look to score on the counter. However, to progress in the World Cup next year, the U.S. can't continue to rely on front-running against top teams. It needs to develop a more effective plan of attack if it does go down a goal and do so, without comprising its ability to keep its shape and defend at the back.

On the bright side, Brad Guzan looked very good as Howard's replacement (his save on Stanislav Sestak to prevent a second Slovakia goal was exceptional), and Jonathan Spector looked very polished at center back (other than playing Sestak onside for the aforementioned shot). I've said for years that Spector seems far more suited to center back than fullback. After watching him impress against Slovakia, I'd argue that until Onyewu returns, the U.S. should start Spector with Jay DeMerit (once he returns from his eye injury) at center back and move Carlos Bocanegra back to left back (unless Edgar Castillo can make that spot his own) to replace Jonathan Bornstein, who remains far short of being international-caliber. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Bocanegra is the ideal left back either, far from it in fact. However, at this point, he's certainly the lesser of two evils there compared to Bornstein.

2. MLS Cup playoffs. Well MLS almost got its ideal scenario of a Galaxy versus Fire matchup in the MLS Cup final (Sunday, 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN, ESPN360.com), which would have been a marketer's dream with David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Brian McBride. Two out of four isn't bad. The Galaxy, of course, overcame Houston 2-0 in a strange game in which the momentum kept shifting dramatically -- the two power outages certainly played their part. The Galaxy started well, then lost their way as the second half was all Houston, then comprehensively outplayed the Dynamo in OT. However, Galaxy goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts got a little lucky when he pushed Brian Ching's header onto the post, and frankly, it was a strange decision by the ref to disallow Andrew Hainault's goal from the subsequent corner.

As for OT, it's a bit harsh to single out Ricardo Clark, especially since he'd played well to that point, but he basically cost Houston the game with a couple of clumsy (and completely needless) challenges on the Galaxy's Alan Gordon. In the first instance, which resulted in Beckham's free kick and Gregg Berhalter's goal -- I'm not sure what Clark was thinking. Aside from the fact that you need to limit the amount of free kicks you give Beckham and the Galaxy, Clark decided to hack down Gordon about 35 yards out from goal, while Gordon was surrounded by two or three Houston players. That's right, Alan Gordon. I guess I must have missed all the numerous instances in his career when Gordon picked up the ball 35 yards from goal, beat two or three guys off the dribble and either slammed the ball into the net or carved open a defense with an incisive pass. Why would you even think about fouling Gordon in that instance? And don't get me started on the second foul, when Gordon had lost control of the ball in the penalty area and was dribbling away from goal before Clark brought him down.

One last note on the Dynamo -- it's safe to say that heralded DP signing Luis Landin brought nothing to the table against the Galaxy. It's probably also safe to assume that the primary reason for that is he looks severely out of shape (and that's probably an understatement).

As for the Eastern Conference final, Real Salt Lake deserved the win against the Fire. RSL largely outplayed Chicago, and if not for a couple of point-blank missed sitters by Robbie Findley and Yura Movsisyan, they would have won comfortably. Although the Fire have the bigger offensive names, the reality is that the well-paced RSL forwards could provide the Galaxy's back line with a far greater test because of their speed."
27,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4651162/count/21/friendlies-prelude-world-cup-final,Friendlies a prelude to the World Cup final?,"There's always something a little frustrating about the way international breaks cut into the club season. Even with World Cup qualifying fixtures taking place this weekend, including what should be two very compelling European games in Ireland-France and Portugal-Bosnia, I find it hard to adjust to the international schedule with domestic leagues in full swing. And distracting me to an even greater degree from the qualifiers are two friendly matches between four of the most serious World Cup contenders: Spain-Argentina and England-Brazil.

England-Brazil: Still No Room For Pato

Let's get to the England-Brazil match first. The buzz surrounding this game has been diminished by the news that the midfield pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard will miss the match, along with a host of other England regulars such as Glen Johnson. Nevertheless, England manager Fabio Capello will have an opportunity to test the mettle of some secondary players against a Brazil side that enters the game full of confidence after breezing though its World Cup qualifiers (read: England might get blown out of the water this weekend).

Brazil comes into the match at full strength, as manager Carlos Dunga has called up most of the players who were instrumental in the team's World Cup qualification. There was, however, a continued and glaring oversight -- the absence of striker Alexandre Pato.

Brazil's recent run of success makes it hard to criticize Dunga. Pato's persistent omission from the squad is hard to understand, however, especially given his strong performances over the past month.

Don't get me wrong, Dunga has molded Brazil into a side that exhibits both flair and toughness, a side that, in my opinion, is the best team in the world right now (yup, I agree with the SPI Rankings). Pato, for whatever reason, has not been included in his first-team plans, and that's fine. But Pato's continued and absolute absence from the squad does not make much sense to me, either.

Outside of Kaka, Pato is probably the most talented Brazilian playing in Europe. It's not simply that he is a tremendous talent; the youngster has also proven to be quite a versatile striker, able to play up top or as the second man. You would think a manager would find a way to get a player of this caliber on his team, even as a backup.

This weekend's omission against England was yet another blow to the young striker's chances of travelling to South Africa next season. Dunga, instead, opted to call up Nilmar and Hulk, while also relying on Robinho, who may not be able to play as he recovers from an ankle injury.

The point is that Pato should no longer be thought of as a player with a bright future. He is a player of the present and one who could really help Brazil this summer, if the team runs into serious injury or needs a spark off the bench.

Spain-Argentina: Welcome, Jesus Navas

Even with Fernando Torres out due to a hernia injury, the Spain-Argentina friendly should be a fun affair for one simple reason: There is no match that will feature more individual talent.

The game itself presents interesting tactical matchups. Spain has a clear advantage in the midfield regardless of who starts. That's what happens when Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Iniesta and Cesc Fabregas are your midfield options.

Argentina counters with the most talented group of forwards in the world. It's astounding that this team can call up Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Sergio Aguero and Ezequiel Lavezzi.

The one player, however, I am most interested in watching is Spain's Jesus Navas. Sevilla's star winger has earned his first call-up, overcoming an anxiety disorder that has kept him from joining the national team in the past.

Navas has been instrumental in Sevilla's impressive start in both La Liga and the Champions League and could add yet another dimension to an already super-talented Spanish squad.

28,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4643883/count/21/galaxy-fire-course-meet,Galaxy and Fire on course to meet,"The battle to be best in the West will be settled at the Home Depot Center, as the Galaxy and Dynamo battle it (Friday, 11 p.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360.com) out for a ticket to Seattle.

Los Angeles came through its SuperClasico series with Chivas (3-2 on aggregate) thanks to moments of individual skill rather than any continuously cohesive team play. Defensive mistakes blighted its first leg performance while, last weekend in the return match, Bruce Arena's side made heavy weather of overcoming a limited opponent, hanging on in the closing stages when the tie should have long been settled.

When a team can boast Landon Donovan and David Beckham as two of its number, it is not surprising that those around such stars look to them for inspiration. However, Houston is not Chivas and, as I wrote before the postseason began, for L.A. to go all the way, it needs others to step up. Mike Magee has played well but Arena still needs more from Edson Buddle.

While the Galaxy's star power has been its trump card, Houston has shown the experience of having been here before. A punishing series against Seattle was won through patience and perseverance -- although Brian Ching's deciding goal was a cracker -- and you can expect another display built on pragmatism, as well as a defense anchored by the ageless Pat Onstad, on Friday.

Not that Houston does not possess game-changing players itself. Ching is a proven match-winner while Dominic Oduro's pace will trouble LA's back line. If that doesn't work, Luis Angel Landin and Cam Weaver offer threats from the bench. To nullify these sizable threats, the Galaxy must limit their service, meaning that the likes of Brad Davis, Brian Mullan and Stuart Holden must be shut down.

One goal was scored in the two games these sides played against each other during the regular season -- Todd Dunivant's strike deciding a June clash at the HDC -- and I would expect it to be similarly close on Friday, although there may be more goals. It might need extra time to separate them but, in the end, the playoffs are often about the stars and I expect the X-factors of Donovan and Beckham to give LA the edge.

Verdict: L.A. 2-1 Houston

Salt Lake vs. Chicago

One night later, the Western champion will discover who it will face at Qwest Field on Nov. 22 when the Fire and RSL meet at Toyota Park.

Chicago will start the game as favorite but, as Columbus discovered, this is not your regular season Salt Lake side. Against New England, Denis Hamlett's men did enough to get through but the greater variety of attacking options available to its next opponent means more improvement is needed. The return of Wilman Conde and Gonzalo Segares would offer more flexibility although I wonder if either of the two will be risked, given their lack of match fitness.

Naturally, Cuauhtemoc Blanco will be the main man for the hosts. The veteran Mexican is one of a number of Fire players for whom this game will the last in the Windy City -- Chris Rolfe and Brandon Prideaux will not be back while the futures of Brian McBride and Marco Pappa are also uncertain -- and, given his sense for the big occasion, I expect a showing similar from the Chicago talisman to that which he gave in the second leg against the Revolution.

However, as RSL showed in overcoming a Guillermo Barros Schelotto-inspired Columbus onslaught last Thursday, Jason Kreis' side has a playoff spirit which can respond favorably to the odds stacked against it. Falling behind will not be part of the game plan but, with the experience of having successfully recovered before, there will be no panic among the Salt Lake ranks should Chicago get the first goal on Saturday.

If Salt Lake is to clinch a first-ever MLS Cup berth, its precocious youngsters and savvy veterans must continue to excel. Robbie Findley's pace could give the Fire defense fits, especially if Dasan Robinson and CJ Brown are its anchors while Yura Movsisyan is also a threat off the bench. Meanwhile, Javier Morales and Andy Williams were at their creative best in the comeback in Columbus and must continue to provide.

A quirk of MLS is that RSL is playing in the championship game of the Eastern Conference a year after taking part in the west's equivalent. Having fallen then to a team from the nation's right coast, can it redress the balance with a shock win of its own? I doubt it, but then who would have predicted that Kreis and his men would get even this far when the postsesason brackets came out? Chicago, you have been warned.

Verdict: Chicago 2-1 Real Salt Lake

A thing that made me go hmmm

Two weeks after I suggested that Jeff Cunningham's goalscoring form could put him back in the national team picture, wouldn't you know it, Bob Bradley went and included the FC Dallas man in his squad for Saturday's friendly in Slovakia. The veteran striker is one of a number of players who will look to use the friendly to remind Bradley of their capabilities.

Among the others is Sacha Kljestan, back in the fold having lost his place following the Confederations Cup, and Robbie Rogers whose left-footedness will make him a contender for a spot on the plane to South Africa. Dax McCarty has also been included and may get a chance in the center of midfield, a position in which the competition for places is particularly fierce.

Less deep is the central defensive pool. With Oguchi Onyewu and Jay DeMerit sidelined for lengthy periods, the USA desperately needs back-ups to seize their chances to shine. Thus, the coming week is a big one for Chad Marshall, Clarence Goodson and Jimmy Conrad."
29,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4629510/count/21/europe-best-look-lock-champions-league,Europe's best look to lock Champions League,"With two match days remaining in the Champions League, some of Europe's biggest clubs face challenges large and small as they look to qualify for the knockout stages of the tournament:

Liverpool's troubles spill into Europe

Liverpool is in the most precarious position of the big European clubs as its nightmare Premier League season has spilled into the Champions League. The Reds currently find themselves in third place in Group E, five points behind second place Fiorentina and qualification into the next round. Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez recently admitted that it will take a ""miracle"" for his squad to advance into the tournament's knockout stages.

Fiorentina's road to the knockout stages also is a difficult one, as it must host group leader Lyon before wrapping up group play, on the road, against Liverpool. A win against Lyon will send Fiorentina through, but a slipup in that game could set up a very interesting final match day at Anfield (providing Liverpool takes care of business against group bottom-feeder Debrencen). The Viola have looked fantastic in both Serie A and the Champions League, yet it remains to be seen if this team has the mental toughness to finish strong in the group. Complicating matters further for the Italian side is news that star striker Adrian Mutu may miss a month of action because of a right knee injury.

While Liverpool's qualification chances are indeed very slim, stranger things have happened on Europe's biggest stage.

Milan and Real delight

As Liverpool continues to sink, A.C. Milan has begun to rise. Less than a month ago, the Italian club appeared to be on its way to one of its worst seasons in recent memory. But a 2-1 Serie A win against Roma in mid-October steadied the ship. The momentum from that victory carried over into the Champions League three days later, when the Italians shocked Real Madrid with a 3-2 road victory. The two wins have seemingly turned the Rossoneri around. This past Tuesday, Milan again faced Madrid, and although the game ended in a 1-1 draw, it was the most complete performance put on by the team all season long.

Frankly, this past week's 1-1 draw between Milan and Madrid was the highest quality Champions League game I've seen this season. It was an open and attractive game (although it did not lack in quality defending), with compelling subplots in the form of one-on-one battles: Clerance Seedorf versus Lass Diarra, Massimo Ambrosini versus Kaka, Gianluca Zambrotta versus Sergio Ramos. It was exactly the type of game you'd expect from the two most successful clubs in the tournament's history.

Madrid also deserves a great deal of credit coming out of the game. October was a roller coaster ride for the Merengues. The loss of Cristiano Ronaldo to an ankle injury was followed by disappointing results in La Liga and the Champions League. A 2-0 La Liga win against Getafe at the end of October helped quell some of the criticisms directed at manager Manuel Pellegrini, and in its most recent game against Milan, the team began to show improvement through Kaka, Karim Benzema and Marcelo, who was deployed in the midfield instead of as a left back.

The draw left Milan and Madrid tied with seven points atop Group C, with Marseille one point behind in third place. Should Milan win its next game against Marseille, it would qualify for the knockout stages. Such a result would also open the door for Madrid to advance, should it beat Zurich.

Barcelona and Inter in tight straights

Group F is the tightest of the Champions League groups, with the four teams separated by two points. Titleholder Barcelona finds itself tied with Rubin Kazan (with five points) after the two teams drew in Russia this week. The draw allowed Inter Milan to move to the top of the group after the Nerazzuri came back to beat Dynamo Kiev with 86th- and 89th-minute goals.

Inter has been unimpressive thus far in the tournament, perhaps a product of high expectations. Manager Jose Mourinho was brought in to conquer Europe, not just continue Inter's dominance in Italy. But before a comeback win against Kiev on Wednesday, the team had managed only three draws in group play.

The Nov. 24 games should go a long way in determining which teams advance from this group, as Barcelona hosts Inter and Kiev travels to Russia to take on Kazan. The last time Inter and Barcelona met, it was a game of contrasting styles, with Barcelona sending attacking surge after attacking surge against a staunch Inter defense. The game ended in a 0-0 draw; it's hard to imagine Barcelona will be held scoreless at home this time around. And although I expect both Inter and Barcelona to find a way to advance out of this group, don't count out Kazan, which has proven to be an admirable and dangerous opponent."
30,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4621839/count/31/playoff-favorites-shaky-ground,Playoff favorites on shaky ground,"With all four ties in the playoffs wide open as they enter their second legs, it seems certain that, come Sunday evening, some of the higher seeds will be clearing out their lockers.

One of those in danger is Columbus, although I expect the Crew to find a way to eliminate Real Salt Lake, which was just 2-11-2 on the road all season. Columbus fans will have to be patient against a side that is likely to come with a defensive mind-set and it will be incumbent upon Guillermo Barros Schelotto and Alejandro Moreno to respond positively to being left out of the first leg.

Staying in the east, Chicago against New England is likely to play out in a similar manner, although I fancy the Revolution's chances more than I do RSL's. Can the Fire deal with the pressure? My tip for MLS Cup has flattered to deceive all season and continued in that manner in the tie's first leg. Afterwards, coach Denis Hamlett was bullish about Chicago's chances about return match, but it remains to be seen whether Chicago can break down what is likely to be a resolute New England rearguard.

I still fancy Houston and Seattle to go to penalties although I do expect there to be goals at Robertson Stadium, as long as both sides can be more clinical with their chances. For Houston, it is important not only that Luis Angel Landin is fit but that he performs. After all, it was for games such as these he was signed as a DP late in the season. Seattle could have Tyrone Marshall back while Fredy Montero should be over the illness that bugged him in the first game.

You would expect both Los Angeles and Chivas to defend better than each did last Sunday, meaning that the sides' second SuperClasico playoff meeting will be a cagier affair. David Beckham needs to step up after he spent much of the first leg on the game's periphery while Goats fans will be hoping to see more of the same from Maykel Galindo, whose pace worried the Galaxy's backline throughout the second half on Sunday.

End the errors

Maybe I'm being picky or getting grumpier in my old age but I cannot help hoping that, whichever teams do prevail this weekend, they do so due to their own excellence rather than opponents' mistakes. We saw plenty of those in the opening legs of the four ties, games which, overall, I felt were disappointing in their level of play.

After a lack of composure in front of goal blighted Seattle against Houston, the first goal of the postseason came about due to a Columbus loss of concentration. Not only was Frankie Hejduk at fault, he allowed Yura Movsisyan to get in a cross, but also the hitherto impressive Eric Brunner, who was beaten at the near post by Robbie Findley.

Meanwhile, both goalkeepers were culpable at Foxborough on Sunday. First, Chris Rolfe capitalized on Matt Reis' inability to hold Marco Pappa's cross and later, as New England fought back, Jon Busch's failure to hold a Pat Phelan header led to Shalrie Joseph bundling home the winner.

However, nothing that preceded it could outdo the comedy of errors we saw at the Home Depot Center as Los Angeles and Chivas repeatedly made basic mistakes to allow their opponents back into the game. It may have been exciting for the fans but I doubt Bruce Arena or Preki enjoyed it.

Let's hope this postseason is remembered for the good, as opposed to anything bad or ugly. After all, I haven't even mentioned referees ...

A thing that made me go hmmm

From the ridiculous to something more sublime. Awards season begins today as MLS announces the winners of the goalkeeper of the year and fair play prizes. Accolades continue to be handed out on an almost-daily basis until shortly before MLS Cup, with the 2009 MVP as well as the commissioner's award the last to be distributed.

I cast my votes last week and gave Jeff Cunningham the nod as my MVP for almost single-handedly pulling FC Dallas back to the brink of the playoffs with game-winning goals in seven of the Hoops' 11 wins. Fredy Montero and Shalrie Joseph were Cunningham's closest rivals in my eyes.

Here are my selections for some of the other big prizes:

Coach: Bruce Arena, Los Angeles (tough call as there were many good candidates)

Goalkeeper: Zach Thornton, Chivas USA (he was also my choice as comeback player of the year)

Defender: Jhon Kennedy Hurtado, Seattle (Geoff Cameron was close and deserves a U.S. call-up)

Rookie: Omar Gonzalez, Los Angeles (I voted before that backpass vs Chivas!)

Newcomer: Fredy Montero, Seattle (teammate Freddie Ljungberg's late-season form saw him considered too)."
31,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4616471/count/31/rsl-revs-take-surprising-leads,RSL and Revs take surprising leads,"Real Salt Lake and New England had to wait until their final regular-season games to clinch spots in the postseason, and both did so with a little help from other teams.

So perhaps it's fitting that both provided the drama and intrigue in the first leg of the MLS playoffs. Each secured a one-goal advantage at home against a higher-seeded opponent, vital lifelines to carry when they hit the road for their return legs.

Here's my breakdown of the first leg of the MLS playoffs:

New England versus Chicago (New England leads 2-1 heading back to Chicago)

I admit, I was among those who bought into the conventional wisdom that suggested New England had too many injuries and not enough firepower offensively to seriously challenge Chicago over two legs. That's in no way an endorsement of Chicago's championship credentials; the Fire's shortcomings are obvious enough. But the Revs couldn't continue to count on Shalrie Joseph to provide cover for the back line, maintain possession in the midfield and venture forward into the box and score goals, could they?

So much for conventional wisdom. Joseph did just that in a 2-1 win at Gillette Stadium, notching a 75th-minute winner to give the Revs a vital one-goal lifeline to bring with them to Chicago.

The Fire probably will leave Foxborough feeling a bit aggrieved. They had a bright start and were rewarded for their ambition and attacking endeavor with a Chris Rolfe goal in the 17th minute. It looked like they might blow the game open a couple of minutes later, but Brian McBride's shot hit the post.

New England's lack of a natural target man in attack is painfully obvious at times. As industrious as Sainey Nyassi and Kenny Mansally are on the wings, neither would be mistaken as a center forward. And Edgaras Jankauskas will give you an honest effort, but not much else.

Not too many teams rely on their holding midfielder to double as a striker. But anyone who has followed the Revs closely this season wouldn't have been surprised to find Joseph essentially spearheading the attack late in the game. It's a tactic I was convinced would fail them come playoff time, but Joseph poked home the game-winner after a scramble in the box to prove me wrong.

Second-leg prediction: Chicago 1, New England 1

Real Salt Lake versus Columbus (RSL leads 1-0 heading back to Columbus)

I'm not so quick to lambast Crew coach Robert Warzycha's decision to leave Guillermo Barros Schelotto and Alejandro Moreno on the bench. He must have had his doubts about their fitness (especially Schelotto's) and was confident enough in his other players to get the result he wanted.

And let's be honest: The result the Crew were aiming for at Rio Tinto was a scoreless draw to bring back home to Columbus. Schelotto and Moreno were not going to offer much to achieve that aim. And the Crew were two minutes and change from achieving that goal, until Robbie Findley grabbed a lifeline for RSL in the dying minutes.

Heading back to Columbus, the focus doesn't change much. The Crew still need to win at home, something they obviously have shown they're more than capable of. Now there's just a little extra pressure, which may not be the worst thing. It gives the players extra initiative to take the attack to RSL, and perhaps will liven up the home crowd.

And Warzycha will have a fully rested reigning MVP at his disposal. The Crew's coach could come up looking smarter by the end of next week. Or he could have some serious explaining to do should Columbus come up short. I'm guessing the former.

Prediction: Columbus 3, Real Salt Lake 1

Chivas versus L.A. Galaxy (Chivas 2, L.A. 2)

It was exciting, to be sure -- but not necessarily in a good way. Maicon Santos' goal in the fourth minute proved to be the only goal scored that didn't come as a result of a shockingly bad, rec-league defensive error.

But while it won't be easy viewing in the film room for the coaches, both sides probably can agree that a draw was a fair result. Either team could have won or lost -- it was just that kind of afternoon. Hopefully, the nerves (or whatever was plaguing the game) will be gone for the second leg.

Preki will have a difficult time keeping Maykel Galindo on the bench to start the second leg. Galindo came on as a second-half substitute to inject some energy into a Chivas attack that seemed a bit shell-shocked heading into the break down 2-1. Although his 50th-minute equalizer was gifted to him from a bad back pass from Omar Gonzalez, he finished the chance well and gave Chivas an added element in attack. It's hard to imagine Preki not giving him full run in the second leg.

Second-leg prediction: L.A. 1, Chivas 0

Seattle versus Houston (Houston 0, Seattle 0 heading back to Houston)

The speed and intensity of the game screamed for goals, but none were forthcoming. It wasn't for lack of effort. Patrick Ianni, who filled in for an injured Tyrone Marshall in Seattle's back line, exhibited the kind of luck the Sounders were destined to have on the night when he saw two headed chances denied: one cleared off the goal line by Brian Mullan, one by the crossbar.

The talking point for me following the game was the performance of the referee, Ricardo Salazar. The numbers suggest Salazar didn't have a great game. He produced three yellow cards for each team, yet the Dynamo committed three times as many fouls as the Sounders (18-6).

But my point about the officiating is less a judgment of Salazar's performance than an observation of the challenges MLS officials face come playoff time. The game was physical, and you didn't need to see Nate Jacqua's head wrapped in bandages to realize that. But isn't there a tacit recognition that referees err on the side of swallowing their whistles come playoff time? It's what makes the NBA playoffs so great to watch. Players, coaches, officials and fans all understand that what was a foul in the regular season isn't going to get called in the playoffs.

After watching the Seattle-Houston game, I'm not so sure that trend translates as well to soccer. The best thing a referee can do early in a game is set a standard for what an acceptable challenge is. Whether players (or fans) perceive that standard as fair or unfair, at least they can reasonably assume what they're allowed to get away with on the field. Salazar was, to be polite, inconsistent in setting that standard in the game. And it took fluidity away from an entertaining, attack-minded game.

Second-leg prediction: Houston 2, Seattle 1

Random thoughts

After watching the first weekend of MLS playoff action and considering the results for Real Salt Lake and New England, I found myself wondering what Kevin Payne would think.

Payne, D.C. United's president, recently stirred up a bit of controversy in MLS circles when he suggested that teams that employ cynical and negative tactics to earn results -- and possibly a playoff berth -- damage the league's image, and that a stronger emphasis on entertaining, attacking style should be embraced. He identified New England and Real Salt Lake as culprits of what he perceives as a bad trend for MLS.

Setting aside whether his argument has merit (it does) or smacks of sour grapes given that D.C. United is watching the playoffs from home (it does), I wonder if he feels vindicated after watching RSL and New England win over the weekend? If it's true that both teams don't play an attacking and entertaining style, yet were rewarded with an invitation to play on the league's biggest stage, is that bad for the league's image, as Payne suggests?"
32,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4607857/count/31/us-u-17s-badly-missing-gyau-renken,TGIF and other musings,"As we head into the Halloween weekend and everyone's trying to decide what their costume is going to be for whatever hell-raising parties they plan on attending, here's my random thoughts for the week this Friday:

1. The U.S. U-17s aren't the same team I saw last year. Based on the poor performances for the first two games of the U-17 World Cup, it's clear that the U.S. team isn't operating at anything close to peak level, and that's mostly a result of the absence from the starting lineup of Charles Renken, Joseph Gyau, and to a lesser extent Sebastian Lletget and Carlos Martinez. Gyau and Renken in particular gave the team a rare (for the U.S.) level of creativity and ability to break defenders down off the dribble, while Martinez is surprisingly on the bench as the far more limited Alex Shinsky starts.

Having said all that, I want this particular squad to do well so that it justifies the decision of the USSF to go with Wilmer Cabrera as the coach. Cabrera should be lauded for the changes in attacking style and philosophy that he's tried to bring to the U-17s. As for Jack McInerney, this is the first time I'm seeing him up close, and I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. Unless McInerney experiences a significant growth spurt, he's basically doomed to be a tweener at the pro level since he plays like a target man striker but without the power or physical presence required. He also appears to lack the technical skill or dribbling ability to compensate for that or work effectively as a link-up player or second forward.

2. When a handball supposedly isn't a handball. If there's one thing that continues to irk me, it's the illogical interpretation of the handball rule by referees, particularly as it pertains to penalties. Wednesday's Carling Cup game between Arsenal and Liverpool highlighted this perfectly. Referee Alan Wiley denied Liverpool a clear penalty late in the game when Alberto Aquilani's overhead kick was blocked by Arsenal's Philippe Senderos with both hands. The argument here is that Aquilani's shot was considered ball to hand and hence not a penalty. However, while that certainly should apply for crosses or wayward shots, when a defender's hand prevents a goalbound shot from scoring, then in my opinion it should be a penalty whether intentional or not. As an aside, I have no doubt that Aquilani, provided he stays healthy, will make Liverpool fans forget all about Xabi Alonso.

3. Strange uniform designs. OK, so as we all know, soccer teams continually change their uniforms to line their own pockets and to force fans to keep buying new merchandise. I get that, not saying it's right, but it's understandable from a business perspective. However, who gets to approve these uniform choices? Last week Arsenal lined up against West Ham in an away kit that had a shocking resemblance to archrival Spurs' traditional home kit. And each year, Manchester United's top looks closer and closer to something you'd find at a Star Trek convention

4. Real farce. One of the most highly amusing results I have witnessed in perhaps the last 15 years occurred Tuesday when the new age Galacticos of Real Madrid lost 4-0 to Spanish third-tier side Alcorcon in the Copa Del Rey. Now usually in the early stages of the Copa Del Rey most Spanish La Liga teams field youngsters or fringe players. However, while Real rested the likes of Iker Casillas, Kaka and Xabi Alonso, the lineup was composed solely of first-team players, including Karim Benzema, Rafael Van der Vaart, Raul and Esteban Granero. In fact, the starting lineup Real put on the field was worth 110 million euros.

Compare that to Alcorcon's team, made of mostly part-timers and checking in at an entire cost of 2 million euros, and yet Real lost, and lost badly -- the final scoreline was actually flattering to Real. What's even more interesting about Alcorcon is that its average salary on the team is a mere 36,000 euros a year -- practically MLS-like, which means two things: First, MLS might want to look into signing up some of Alcorcon's players, and second, Manuel Pelligrini is sure to be an ex-Real coach soon.

5. Houston vs. Seattle. Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinal between these two teams ended in a 0-0 draw, although with a bit more luck, former Dynamo Patrick Ianni could easily have scored twice for the Sounders. I think the winner of this matchup has a very good shot at going all the way, although with Seattle's team speed on offense, I suspect the Galaxy (assuming they beat Chivas USA) would rather face Houston in the Conference final. As for Seattle, I've got a soft spot for Sigi Schmid's men because the Sounders are undoubtedly the most aesthetically pleasing team to watch in MLS. (Let's face it: There's some truth in what D.C. president Kevin Payne said the other day about MLS games in general, not any teams in particular.)"
33,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4601248/count/31/mls-playoff-prognostications,MLS playoff prognostications,"Real Salt Lake and New England did what they had to do, while their four rivals for the final two playoff spots failed with varying degrees of absurdity to seize opportunities -- meaning that we finally have a postseason lineup of eight teams, from which one will emerge to lift the MLS Cup.

At the start of the year, I picked Chicago to beat Los Angeles in the MLS Cup. Although I'm not convinced of such an outcome by any means, there is no obviously safer prediction, so I'll stick to my guns. However, before we crown the team that will succeed in Seattle, there are conference semifinals to be played.

Columbus Crew versus Real Salt Lake

Columbus may have won only one of its final four games, but Robert Warzycha's side should have too much for Real Salt Lake, which hardly enters the playoffs in prime form itself.

In RSL's favor is the opportunity to play the first leg at Rio Tinto, where it lost just once all year and where, lest we forget, Columbus was the recipient of a 4-1 shellacking back in April. Robbie Findley scored a hat trick that night, and he'll be a key man once again -- especially if Chad Marshall is missing for the Crew.

However, even without the U.S. international, Columbus has sufficient quality throughout its squad to survive a tricky trip to Utah before finishing the job at home. RSL's back line will struggle to contain the likes of Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Robbie Rogers, Alejandro Moreno and Eddie Gaven.

Verdict: Columbus advances 3-1 on aggregate.

Chicago Fire versus New England Revolution

It wouldn't be an MLS postseason without a New England-versus-Chicago matchup, would it? The two sides meet in the playoffs for the seventh time in eight years and Chicago enters this tie as a clear favorite to advance.

Each side is undefeated against the other on its home field in the playoffs and, for New England especially, it's vital that this trend continues. The Revolution have made the postseason despite losing a host of internationals (to injury) and assistant coach Paul Mariner (to Plymouth). If they're to progress further, they'll have to take a lead to Toyota Park.

Not that Chicago is necessarily firing on all cylinders. Last Thursday's 1-0 win over Chivas was the first by Denis Hamlett's men in seven games and, though talent is abundant throughout its roster, the suspicion remains that the Fire's correct blend of players and tactics has yet to be found. It may get past a goal-shy New England side, but if my MLS Cup prediction is to come true, Chicago has to show more than the spasmodic form we've seen to date this year.

Verdict: Chicago advances 2-0 on aggregate.

Los Angeles Galaxy versus Chivas USA

The first playoff meeting of these SuperClasico rivals matches up two teams that had contrasting regular seasons. While Chivas began the season in fine form, Los Angeles gained momentum through the second half, recording six wins in its last 11 games.

Los Angeles won two of the three meetings between the sides in the regular season by 1-0 scores, and breaching the Galaxy's improved defense will again be Chivaas' biggest challenge. Of the eight playoff teams, only New England has scored fewer goals than Chivas in 2009, and it will be incumbent on Sacha Kljestan to take a leading creative role.

The Galaxy has more star power but will need more than flair to get past their gritty Home Depot Center cohabitants. With Chivas likely to try slowing down the game, will the likes of David Beckham and Landon Donovan be able to find enough space from which to dictate? If not, who can step up? Edson Buddle, who got the winner in the teams' July meeting, may be a key figure.

Verdict: Los Angeles advances 3-1 on aggregate.

Houston Dynamo versus Seattle Sounders

Featuring two evenly matched sides, both of which are more than capable of winning the MLS Cup, this is the closest tie to call. Furthermore, sprinkled throughout Houston's and Seattle's ranks are many players who know what it takes to win a championship.

Dominic Kinnear and Sigi Schmid have pretty decent playoff pedigrees, too, and this matchup may be decided by which of the two adjusts more effectively within games. On the field, the form of both teams has contrasted recently. Seattle ended the regular season with three straight wins, although its home form has slipped. Last weekend's win over Dallas ended a run of three straight games at Qwest Field in which the hosts failed to score.

Meanwhile, Houston has won just twice in league play since the middle of August, as a hectic schedule (which featured six CONCACAF Champions League games) appeared to take its toll. The jury remains out on Luis Angel Landin, who scored just once in seven games. The Mexican's DP battle with Freddie Ljungberg -- Seattle's big-money man has four assists in his last two games -- is another of the tie's pivotal clashes.

Verdict: Seattle advances on penalties (aggregate 2-2).

A thing that made me go hmmm â¦

D.C. United president Kevin Payne had some interesting things to say in the aftermath of the club's failure to reach the playoffs. According to Steven Goff's blog in the Washington Post, Payne suggested that some teams -- he mentioned New England, Salt Lake and Colorado specifically -- adopt an overly conservative approach that he believes may turn some off MLS.

D.C. United would, in Payne's words, ""rather attack than cynically defend."" Hmmm. This is a club that scored nine goals in its final 10 games. And given that Tom Soehn's side failed to win 10 of the 17 matches in which it scored the first goal, perhaps a more pragmatic mindset would have resulted in its season lasting a little longer.

Although Payne's concern for the overall well-being of the league is admirable, I wonder if he shouldn't be more concerned that D.C. United has failed to reach the postseason for two straight years under his watch. I wonder how many of the club's fans would swap places with followers of the Revolution and RSL, who are preparing for a playoff campaign.

Payne may be correct when he says D.C. has ""a lot more trophies in our case than everybody else,"" but only four have arrived at RFK Stadium this century and only one of those was an MLS Cup. Given D.C.'s ongoing issues on and off the field, perhaps its supporters wish for the focus of its president to stay a little closer to home.

Well-played, golden man

His goals may not have been quite enough to sneak FC Dallas into the playoffs, but from a personal standpoint Jeff Cunningham has something to celebrate after claiming the second golden boot of his career, following a campaign in which he scored 17 times.

The 33-year-old Cunningham, who previously won the award in 2006 after a 16-goal season with Real Salt Lake, also got my vote for league MVP. Although Dallas didn't make the postseason, that it even came close was due in no small part to Cunningham, who scored game-winning goals in seven of the Hoops' 11 victories.

Dallas under Schellas Hyndman is certainly a team to watch in 2010 and, despite his advancing years, Cunningham will remain a key man. Furthermore, I'll sign off this week with this out-of-left-field thought: If he starts next season in the form he ended this year, could Cunningham force his way into contention for a spot on the U.S. World Cup squad?

34,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4595308/count/31/torres-produces-magic-man-united,Torres produces magic against Man United,"On Sunday, Liverpool put forth a courageous display in a 2-0 victory over Manchester United, and Rafa Benitez's men did it without the services of captain Steven Gerrard. And while there is plenty of praise to go around, it's hard to imagine where this team would be without striker Fernando Torres. Simply put, Torres may be more valuable to Liverpool than any other player is to a major European club. But before praising Torres, I wish to tip my hat to some of the other protagonists in Sunday's game.

Yossi Benayoun continues to exhibit the much-needed creativity he brings to Liverpool's midfield. His pass into space, which opened up United's defense on Torres' go-ahead goal, was brilliant. Equally important on the game's opening the goal was Dirk Kuyt's patience in finding Benayoun. On the play, Kuyt had a chance to play the ball to Torres but realized the Spaniard was offside. Instead, he opted to pass the ball back to Banayoun, who immediately found a now-onside Torres for the score.

Also deserving of praise is the midfield pairing of Javier Mascherano and Lucas. Mascherano was his usual dominant self and much-maligned Brazilian Lucas was a positive force for a change. While at the back, Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger stifled United's attacks.

Now to Torres. His 65th-minute goal not only showed off his speed and ball control but also his strength, as he held off defender Rio Ferdinand before firing home a right-footed shot, from a difficult angle, into the roof of the United net. The moment Torres got on the end of the Benayoun pass, there was no doubt he was going to score.

It wasn't only the manner in which he scored that was so impressive, but also the stage on which it took place: In a game that Liverpool had to win, the not-fully-fit Torres delivered a fantastic goal that very few other strikers could have finished.

Now, there is no question Torres is one of the top two strikers in the world. But his continued quality and his importance to Liverpool have me wondering just where he fits in the best-player-in-the-world debate.

Right now, if you were starting a team, is there anyone other than Lionel Messi you'd want more than Torres? I can hear legitimate cries for Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo. And although Ronaldo is hard to argue against, Kaka has yet to show the quality he demonstrated a few years ago at A.C. Milan, where he was winning individual and team awards. Didier Drogba is another solid contender, but his streakiness and attitude come into question in this type of debate. (It's hard to imagine Torres slapping an opponent at a critical juncture of a Champions League final.) Zlatan Ibrahimovic is another player worth mentioning, but it took a transfer to the best team in the world for his full potential to emerge. Torres does much more than Ibrahimovic, and with much less.

Of course, there are subtler players one may want to build a team around: Xavi or Andres Iniesta, midfield architects who aren't as explosive in their game but who are critical to midfield structure and the offensive buildup. I would be hard-pressed to argue with anyone who wanted to build around such players.

In light of that, perhaps the question is an entirely different one: If you could watch only one player each week, who would it be? Again, I'd pick Torres, for the simple reason that so many of Europe's most powerful teams are made up of ensembles of great players. For example, any number of Barcelona's players could deliver the top performance of a match, and the same goes for Chelsea and Real Madrid. When I watch Liverpool, I know Torres will be the central figure, the point of entertainment and brilliance. He is the straw that stirs the drink.

And should Torres continue at this pace, at season's end he won't be only the best player at Liverpool. He'll be the best player in the world.

35,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4587859/count/31/mls-playoff-race-enters-deciding-weekend,MLS playoff race enters deciding weekend,"After the Chicago Fire clinched a postseason berth with a 1-0 victory over Chivas USA on Thursday night, two spots remain in this season's playoffs and, entering the final round of games, six clubs retain hope of playing beyond this weekend. So, who'll be in and who'll be out?

A quirk of the schedule means that all but one of the half-dozen hopefuls will have to do their work on the road. The only club with playoff ambitions to have a home game to look forward to is Real Salt Lake, which gives coach Jason Kreis' side a great chance of extending its season, despite the fact that it is currently the candidate furthest away from the top eight.

However, I would be surprised if RSL is celebrating on Saturday night. For one, it has won just once since the end of August. More pertinent, though, is the desperation with which its opponent, the Colorado Rapids, will be playing. Allied with a front two of Conor Casey and Omar Cummings, who have 24 goals and 13 assists between them in 2009, it should be enough for the Rapids to get a result.

Whether it is a clincher or just a spoiler for RSL's hopes will depend on what happens elsewhere. Colorado is one of the two sides that enters the weekend ""in"" the playoffs. The other is Toronto FC, which (on paper) has the easiest game of all, in that it faces the league's worst team, the New York Red Bulls. In the final soccer game at Giants Stadium, can TFC make some history of its own?

For what it's worth, my feeling is that Colorado will do enough to qualify and will be joined in the playoffs by D.C. United, which I fancy to win at the Kansas City Wizards and enjoy a little help from other results. I would not be shocked if FC Dallas, which has won four straight and seven of 11 games since the all-star break, completes a remarkable second half by winning at Seattle, but the Sounders' hopes of winning the West make things harder for coach Schellas Hyndman and his rejuvenated FCD squad.

And what of the New England Revolution, I hear you say? Having made the postseason for seven straight years, the Revs have a proud record to defend. But with so many stars sidelined due to injury, New England is up against it at the Columbus Crew on Sunday. The Crew has clinched the Supporters' Shield and so has little to play for but, as was seen just two weeks ago at Gillette Stadium, has the strength in depth to beat New England even with key men missing.

A thing that made me go hmmm

One thing that does play into New England's favor is timing, in that coach Steve Nicol and his players will know exactly what they need to do to reach the playoffs by the time their game begins.

A mea culpa: Yes, I'm beating the same drum for the second straight year ... but, once again, it is disappointing that MLS has not been able (or willing) to schedule the final round of matches to kick off at the same time. Imagine the dramatic possibilities of having seven games in progress concurrently. No team could gain an advantage by knowing the results of its rivals, while fans' match experience would be enhanced by frantic scoreboard watching.

Admittedly, there are many reasons why this isn't happening. For example, in a 15-club league, one team is left off the weekend schedule, and differing time zones are also a factor. Plus, there are existing commitments that stadia have made with other organizations, some of which are MLS-related, as is the case with the Los Angeles Galaxy and Chivas USA, both of which are in action at the Home Depot Center.

Still, it's a shame. Given the many permutations that exist, there is every chance that the final weekend of the regular season will be every bit as exciting as we all hope. However, the staggered nature of the schedule means that there will be no extra drama generated by having all the teams in action at once."
36,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4581168/count/31/turning-my-attention-mls-playoff-race,Turning my attention to the MLS playoff race,"I originally intended to comment on what's been a frenzied and emotional past 10 days for the U.S. men's national team. The big picture was pleasant enough. Unbeaten in their final two WCQ games, the Americans booked a ticket to South Africa in 2010.

But delving deeply into the smaller subplots surrounding the team was a dizzying enterprise. A quick glance at ESPNSoccernet's headlines reveals the danger of trying to closely examine this team right now. Charlie Davies has been moved from intensive care. Oguchi Onyewu underwent knee surgery. Jay DeMerit had his cornea replaced. I didn't even know that was possible. The news, however, wasn't entirely bad. Apparently, Jonathan Bornstein, much criticized in his own country, will never pay for a meal in his life in Honduras, if that's any consolation. I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up.

That's why I decided the pressing questions will have to wait for another day. Questions like: Is Chad Marshall a national-caliber center back or just a reliable squad player? Will Stuart Holden take the next step and cement his place in Bob Bradley's starting 11? Can Maurice Edu get back to full fitness and challenge Ricardo Clark, and possibly Michael Bradley, for a place in the midfield? Will Jozy Altidore get the regular minutes he needs? There's plenty of time until South Africa for those questions to be answered. It all seems like too much to digest, so I'll leave the plate full, for now.

Instead, I decided to ease my brain and turn my attention to the MLS playoff race. Entering the season's final weekend, the playoff picture is far from settled. Five teams have clinched postseason berths, while seven battle for the final three spots. Here's my two cents on each of the teams that have either booked a place or are still in the race:

In it to win it

Columbus (49 points, vs. New England) -- MLS teams haven't been able to develop the squad depth and quality to be able to seriously compete in multiple competitions. Columbus is beginning to reach that standard. Watching the Crew beat a New England team fighting for its playoff life on the road was impressive. Remembering the regulars who weren't in the side made me shake my head and wonder what the rest of the league is going to do to stop them this year.

Los Angeles (45 points, vs. San Jose) -- On a good day, L.A. can beat anybody. On a bad day, well, it can concede six goals to Dallas at home. That's a harsh take on what has been a vastly improved and mostly impressive Galaxy back line. But they'll probably need Landon Donovan to win a match or two on his own to go deep in the postseason.

Houston (45 points, at Chivas) -- Houston looks like the team with the horses to challenge Columbus, if it can get that far. Though, as the Dynamo's recent game against L.A. as well as the standings show, not much separates these two in the Western Conference.

Chivas (45 points, at Chicago, vs. Houston) -- Chivas is one of the hottest teams in the league right now. An unbeaten streak (six games), a hot goalkeeper (Zach Thornton) and a player with something to prove (Sacha Kljestan) are all things that can come in handy in the postseason. Home-field advantage wouldn't hurt, either.

Seattle (44 points, vs. Dallas) -- Seattle was always a popular dark horse to go all the way with its dynamic, explosive attack and a secret weapon in Qwest Field. The goals have dried up recently, but three goals in a comeback win over Kansas City this past week will bring a sigh of relief for Sounders fans.

Work left to do

Chicago (42 points, vs. Chivas) -- This team is way too good on paper to not make the playoffs and needs only a draw in its final game to clinch. But that's not really a ringing endorsement, especially for a side that's had trouble winning at home and would be limping into the postseason.

Colorado (40 points, at RSL) -- Another team that hasn't done itself any favors in the late stretch with nothing but a pile of ties and a tough away match at Real Salt Lake to show for it. Unfortunately for the Rapids, another draw may not be good enough Saturday.

Dallas (39 points, at Seattle) -- Four wins in a row has inexplicably kept Dallas in the hunt. It'll hope to catch Seattle napping in Qwest Stadium in its final game, but three points is still a hard ask there, even if the Sounders go to sleep in Seattle in their final game.

D.C. United (39 points, at Kansas City) -- Hasn't looked like a playoff team of late, but a recent win over Columbus may have breathed new life into D.C. heading into the home stretch. Away to Kansas City should be a winnable game to give them a chance.

New England (39 points, at Columbus) -- The fact that New England still has a chance is worthy of praise. But despite no shortage of effort in almost impossible circumstances, the results just haven't been there -- and the Revs end against the league's best team. Not good.

Toronto (39 points, at N.Y.) -- I still can't decide if having to beat the worst team in the league (New York) on the road for a chance to go to the playoffs for the first time is a blessing or a curse.

Real Salt Lake (37 points, vs. Colorado) -- Long shot. RSL spent too much of the latter part of the season trading wins with losses to put it in the postseason."
37,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4577386/count/31/beckham-try-luck-milan-again,Beckham to try his luck in Milan again,"It looks like David Beckham is likely headed back for another winter loan spell with A.C. Milan. While the move will unquestionably help the English international's hopes of participating in the 2010 World Cup, it is just another example of Milan putting marketability ahead of on-field success.

This is not intended to be a criticism of Beckham in any way. The man has had an incredible career and is a player I still rate highly. And I must admit Beckham played very well for Milan, particularly in the early stage of his loan last season.

Nevertheless, I cannot help but feel this is the wrong move for a team in desperate need of a rejuvenated and energetic midfield if they are to finish in Italy's top four at the end of the year.

Milan's biggest problem right now is the advanced age of its starting lineup. This is the result of the team having chosen to sign big, aging names, while rivals Inter and Juventus stacked up on youth and quality. Such a philosophy in the transfer market has finally caught up with the Rossoneri this season. The team is off to a disastrous start in Serie A. In eight league games, Milan has managed to score a paltry six goals (16 of 20 Serie A teams have better scoring records) and find themselves in eighth place in the standings.

Some of the blame for the team's scoring woes falls on the shoulders of young Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato, but more of the blame should rest on an unimaginative and sluggish midfield, which is in desperate need of a spark since Kaka's departure this summer. And while I have a great deal of respect for Beckham's soccer accomplishments, I don't believe a 34-year-old midfielder is the spark this team is looking for.

So why has Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani come back to Beckham as an option? The most obvious answer is to bring a very average club the global attention it so desperately craves. In recent years under Galliani, Milan has been more concerned with its off-field brand than its on-field quality. Before Beckham's loan spell last season, there was the questionable signing of Ronaldinho and, before that, the disastrous Ronaldo experiment.

Where Beckham is concerned, this is a perfect move and I applaud him for it. He is going to a squad he's familiar with and one with which he is sure to get plenty of starts. He even has a chance to show off his skills on the biggest of European stages, should Milan qualify for the Champions League knockout stages.

In the end Beckham's seemingly inevitable return to Milan will greatly benefit the player in the short term. And where Milan is concerned, I expect more of the same struggles with or without him."
38,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4561923/count/31/i-beat-snot-elmo,I beat the snot out of Elmo,"With two more games remaining in the season, and our fate already sealed, there is not much to be said about our year. We started out on the wrong foot and were never able to put the other one down and right the wrongs. Now, there are many reasons why this happened -- some of which I have written about over the past several months and others that I will not reveal.

The only thing that you can do in a situation like this is be as proactive as possible. Since Richie Williams took the helm six games ago, we have gone 2-2-2 while giving up only six goals, which was among the fewest in the league in that span. Not bad considering we managed only two wins in the previous 22 games.

The biggest difference has been the accountability that we have been held to, especially with team defense. A lot of times in the beginning of the season, it seemed like we had two teams on the field. Half of us played defense while the other half attacked. Over the past two months, we have turned that habit around and it has shown.

It is important that we get the most out of our last two games for a variety of reasons. With the playoffs out of the picture for us, it is vital that we start to prepare for next season, when we open up our brand new stadium, Red Bull Arena. I wish I had more to write about on the soccer end, but it has certainly been an uneventful year. Next season I plan on filling these pages with story upon story of how it feels to be in first place. Now that's proactive.

For those of you who read my blog a few months ago entitled ""Seeing red with Elmo,"" you already know how I feel about Elmo. Well I finally had my chance to seek my revenge, and I seized the moment.

We threw a joint birthday party for my 5- and 2-year-old boys. Nothing crazy. Just 25 sugared-up psychos running around my yard for three hours while their parents sat inside and devoured my liquor cabinet like a young Petke on Prom Night.

The party had two themes going: For the 5-year-old it was ""Pirates of the Caribbean""; for the 2-year-old it was -- wouldn't you know it -- Elmo. I swear my wife loves to irritate me. Now you should know that my role in planning this party was minimal because, um, how should I put this I'm a guy. I have learned over eight wonderful years of marriage that whenever your wife asks your opinion about home decor, what you would like to do on your day off and especially planning a birthday party for your kids, she is just being courteous. Your opinion matters not a bit in those subjects.

So as the sixth kid stepped out of the jump house with a bloody lip, my wife asked me to get the piÃ±atas ready. So I hung the first one up for my 5-year-old, which was a pirate. All the kids lined up and smacked the crap out of it until it bled candy, then they proceeded to perform MMA moves on each other in order to get the most candy (three more bloody lips, by the way). Then it was time to hang the 2-year-old's up and repeat the process. I obviously knew what it would be, but as I reached into the bag and pulled out the piÃ±ata, I was overjoyed when it was -- wouldn't you know -- Elmo. As I yanked the stick out of the hands of my youngest and gently shoved him aside, I was excited. I gripped the bat like A-Rod and prepared to seek revenge. When my wife intervened and pried the bat from my grip, I thought my dream was crushed. But after five minutes of 2-year-olds hitting Elmo with the force of a finger-flick, my wife gave me the nod, and I tore his red head right off his shoulders and dumped the candy out with a smile on my face.

Vengeance is a beautiful thing."
39,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4558073/count/31/davies-ascent-stardom-halted-tragedy,Davies' ascent to stardom halted by tragedy,"The game against Costa Rica was supposed to be a celebration.

The U.S. men's national team had already secured its bid to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The heavy lifting was already done. There was no objective, no pressure for the Americans heading into their final qualifier Wednesday night in Washington, D.C., other than to enjoy a sixth consecutive World Cup appearance in front of their home fans.

Suddenly, none of that seems very important.

Not after the news that U.S. forward Charlie Davies was involved in a tragic car accident early Tuesday morning that claimed the life of one passenger, 22-year-old Ashley Roberta, and left Davies and another passenger severely injured.

When placed in the context of such tragedy, soccer takes a backseat. And rightfully so. The mood at RFK Stadium Wednesday night will be more somber than celebratory, reflecting the events of the last 36 hours. But Bob Bradley still has a job to do against Costa Rica. Only now he has to do it without a player who had recently established himself as a regular in the national side's starting 11 as well as its natural No. 9.

It wouldn't be entirely true to say that Davies' ascension in the national ranks, however rapid, came out of nowhere. He was no stranger to the youth national sides and his name was always among the first spoken when pressed to identify one of America's most promising talents. He possessed a mixture of physical strength and pace that needed only some professional polishing and tactical refinement to form a devastating mixture.

To do so, Davies disappeared off the radar of all but the most ardent U.S. fans. After a brief college stint at BC, he spurned the MLS to embark on the European professional odyssey that has swallowed up other talented American players.

He headed to Hammarby in Sweden, where he struggled initially but eventually found his footing and excelled. He remained on coach Bob Bradley's radar, receiving sporadic call-ups, but it wasn't until the Confederations Cup in South Africa in June that he made himself a permanent fixture on Bradley's squad.

The opportunity for Davies to shine actually arose out of disaster. An opening-game loss to Italy, followed by an embarrassing 3-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil, meant the Americans needed a convincing result in their final game to have any chance of qualifying to the group stages. It also meant Bradley needed to mix things up and find a spark.

Enter Davies.

It started against Egypt on June 21 in the final game of the group stages. Davies was given the start and scored the U.S. team's opening goal in an eventual 3-0 win. It was an awkward sequence that certainly wasn't one for the highlight reels, but it opened the floodgates for what became a historic run of play for the Americans. They went on to beat Spain in the semifinals before falling to Brazil 3-2 in the final -- with Davies starting each of those matches alongside Jozy Altidore.

After the Confederations Cup, U.S. fans were convinced they'd finally found the strike partnership they'd been hoping for in Davies and Altidore. They'd finally found a blossoming and imposing forward tandem to compete on the world stage.

However, a funny thing happened on the road to South Africa 2010. Whereas Davies left the Confederations Cup as the newly minted 1B to Altidore's 1A, he wasted no time forcing himself to the forefront of Bradley's thinking.

It started in the Estadio Azteca on Aug. 12 in a World Cup qualifier against Mexico. It was there in Mexico City that Bradley started Davies alongside Brian Ching, leaving Altidore to play the role of super sub. Davies rewarded his coach's confidence with a clinical finish that gave the Americans a shocking early lead. The U.S. would go on to lose 2-1, but the message was delivered: There was a new No. 9 in town.

(No. 9 is usually the number given to a star striker or the best striker on a team.)

By the time the Honduras match arrived on Oct. 10, the surprise heading into the game wasn't which strike partnership Bradley would select -- by now you could be sure Davies was going to be in the starting 11. The unknown was who he would opt to play alongside Davies (which actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise in Conor Casey).

Davies was part of the buildup that led to Conor Casey's second goal against Honduras in a 3-2 win that secured America's passage to South Africa. To be sure, he missed a wide-open header in the first half courtesy of a Stuart Holden cross. He then skied the ensuing rebound over the crossbar, when he had the goal at his mercy.

But the miss, however shocking, wasn't followed by cries for his dismissal from U.S. fans. Not after the Confederations Cup. Not after the goal at the Azteca. Rather, it was followed by a wink and a nod that suggested, ""Wait till he gets a few more games under his belt and he'll be putting those away for fun."" Unless of course, the unthinkable happens.

Fast-forward to today. The unthinkable has happened. Davies underwent surgery Tuesday afternoon for his injuries, which included a broken leg, lacerated bladder, a fractured elbow and facial fractures. Early estimates put his recovery at 6-12 months, making his participation in next year's World Cup very unlikely. We don't know what kind of rehabilitation he faces when he's released from the hospital. We don't know if he'll be able to return to being the same player he was after rehab. We don't know the details that led to the accident. What we do know is that he's lucky to be alive. And we also know that during his absence, we'll be left to wonder what might have been."

It was quite simply one of the most entertaining games you'll ever see in CONCACAF -- the type of game that either team could have won and in which, to some degree, you just throw all the analysis out of the window and simply enjoy the action. Here's what I'm thinking in the aftermath:

1. Weathering the storm. For U.S. fans able to watch the first half, it was somewhat akin to a horror show, as the Hondurans completely dominated. The U.S. central midfield pairing of Michael Bradley and Ricardo Clark was overrun by their Honduran counterparts Wilson Palacios and Hendry Thomas, and were an absolute non-factor. Yet, of the half's three best chances, the U.S. had two of them -- both point-blank chances that should have been buried by Charlie Davies and Carlos Bocanegra -- and it was obvious that the U.S. would always threaten on the counterattack. At this juncture, it was easy to conclude that the U.S. would be best served withdrawing one of its two forwards and bringing on an extra midfielder such as Benny Feilhaber or Jose Torres at the start of the second to help stem Honduras' possession. And yet, to his credit, coach Bob Bradley stuck to his guns and his initial game plan, which brings me to

2. Conor Casey vindicates Bradley's decision. I'm pretty sure that all across America there were really only two reactions when one first saw Casey's name in the starting lineup: either shock at Casey's inclusion or dismay at Jozy Altidore's exclusion. I'll be the first to admit that I don't see Casey as an international-caliber forward, but he did open my eyes somewhat with his display against Everton for the MLS All-Stars back in July, when he proved he could provide a powerful physical presence against Premiership-caliber defenders.

After his two-goal display at Estadio Olimpico, I might have to revise my thinking somewhat -- he's certainly got the edge over Brian Ching as a target man if he keeps playing like this. At the same time, let's not get too carried away. Casey's first goal was more a result of a goalkeeping error than anything else, and unlikely against most countries with a quality player in that position. However, given the U.S. team's style of play, we could see Casey being used more in tandem with Davies or Altidore, with the loser of the Davies/Altidore duel being used in an off-the-bench role.

3. The U.S. team's shakiness when holding leads. For a team that prides itself on defensive solidity, the U.S. team certainly has a lot of trouble holding onto leads. It's one thing to throw away a two-goal lead in a half against the likes of Brazil, but the U.S. almost managed to throw away a two-goal lead with just 21 minutes remaining in the game. This could very easily have been an epic capitulation by the U.S. that would have gone down in Honduran folklore.

Considering that in addition to the second goal it conceded, the U.S. allowed a goal that was narrowly ruled offside; a late penalty that was horribly missed by the unfortunate Carlos Pavon; and, to cap it all off, an almost equally glaring miss by Pavon with minutes left when he was inexplicably left all alone for a free header just five yards out.

A large part of the problem continues to be the U.S. midfield's inability to control tempo or possession and the continued poor play by the U.S. fullbacks. However, you also have to wonder why coach Bradley didn't bring on an extra midfielder after the U.S.' third goal, or at least right after Honduras scored its second in the 78th minute. It might be quibbling on my part, but I still think Bradley's management of his subs needs improvement.

4. Kudos to Bob Bradley. One only has to look at the difference that Fabio Capello has made with England to see the impact that a great coach can have, even when he's working with exactly the same set of players as his predecessor.

Is there any question in my mind that a coach like Capello or Guus Hiddink could get more out of this U.S. team than Bob Bradley? Of course he could -- that's not even debatable. Would I love to see what an iconic coach could do working with the U.S. player pool? Absolutely.

However, as I said at the time of Bradley's hiring, if the USSF failed in its attempts to land an elite coach, then you could also do far worse than Bradley (as Mexico subsequently showed when it hired Sven-Goran Ericksson, someone I thought wasn't worth considering).

That being the case, Bradley does deserve recognition for what he's achieved this year, and U.S. fans should savor reaching South Africa -- especially when you consider a team like Croatia, loaded with stars such as Luka Modric, Eduardo and Darijo Srna, likely will not be there. At the same time, we still have to remember that qualifying for the World Cup out of CONCACAF is the minimum criterion for any U.S. coach these days."
41,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4544574/count/41/honduras-likely-trouble-us,Honduras likely to be trouble for the U.S.,"Count me among the frustrated fans looking for a way to watch the U.S. men's national team's match at Honduras, which is only available on pay-per-view closed-circuit television, on Saturday at 10 p.m. ET, .

It is especially maddening considering how high the stakes are for Bob Bradley's side. A win would punch America's ticket to South Africa in 2010. A draw or a loss -- coupled with a Costa Rica win -- would ratchet up the pressure for the U.S. team's WCQ finale against Costa Rica at RFK Stadium on Oct. 14 (ESPN2, 8 p.m. ET).

No one likes the idea of missing out on such an important match. But the truth is this game might be hard to stomach for many U.S. fans. Enough so, dare I say, that one might feel a little thankful for a blackout. Consider the circumstances stacked against the U.S. side -- and fans -- heading into Saturday's match:

1. Honduras' 12th man: There are no guarantees in this game. But we can assume with reasonable certainty the U.S. team will never play on its home soil with the country torn apart by a coup, as is the case with Honduras.

This match offers a striking example of the profoundly different significance of these games in countries other than our own. Not better, not worse, but definitely different.

The political unrest in Honduras almost saw the match moved outside the country. With the game in Honduras, the U.S. can expect to face an emotional mix of passion, politics and soccer. Eleven Hondurans will be tough enough -- adding a 12th man to the mix, in the shape of the crowd, will make it all the more difficult.

2. Bradley Ball: This is less a criticism than a statement of the obvious: This match doesn't figure to be easy on the eyes. If you're looking for a free-flowing, attacking game you might be tempted to cover your eyes during this one -- though in this case you won't have to.

Bob Bradley's never been accused of being overly ambitious with his offensive tactics. Add the loss of Clint Dempsey to a shoulder injury to Honduras' perfect home record (8-0-0) in WCQ and you've got the blueprint for a Bradley game plan that's going to demand plenty of numbers behind the ball at all times.

The Hondurans, needing the three points more and powered by their home supporters, will have the impetus to bring the attack to the U.S. They'll want to draw the Americans out of their defensive shape, opening up space for their playmakers to have time on the ball.

Bradley won't take the bait. The U.S. will be organized and won't commit too many numbers forward. It's a solid recipe for success on the road in a hostile environment, but not necessarily one for attractive soccer.

3. Club vs. country: Stop me if you've heard this before: The lack of playing time for regular national team players at their European clubs is a cause for concern ahead of pivotal qualifying games.

It's an exasperating and persistent dilemma that is all too familiar to American fans. We rightly applaud players who seek tougher challenges (and better paychecks) overseas, understanding that the more competitive environment will better prepare them for international competition. Everybody wins, right?

But too many national team regulars are struggling to get a consistent run with their professional clubs. Can we expect to see them at full match fitness for such important qualifiers? In this case, we won't have to.

4. Dempsey debate: Dempsey's absence got me thinking about criticism that's often leveled against the Fulham midfielder concerning his play for the national team.

I can understand Dempsey's lackadaisical style can rub fans the wrong way. He's not always the first to throw himself in a 50-50 challenge or track back defensively. Sometimes he has a maddening tendency to drift in and out of games.

Points all taken.

But there are players in the U.S. side who do those things and do them well. There aren't, however, players who do what Dempsey does. No player outside of Landon Donovan has the combination of patience, guile, creativity and skill that Dempsey has to unlock a pass or create space for others.

Despite the obvious talents of whoever his replacement is -- whether it be Benny Feilhaber, Stuart Holden or Jose Torres -- there will be an absence of quality that will be clear. Thankfully for those calling for Dempsey to be punished for his perceived lapses in concentration with a seat on the bench, they won't be able to witness it for themselves. And the debate can rage on.

5. Wilson Palacios: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Palacios patrol the midfield for either Honduras or Tottenham in the English Premier League, be thankful you won't witness him for the first time against the U.S.

If any one player can cause the U.S. team fits Saturday night, Honduras' bruising midfielder will be the man to do it. He possesses that rare combination of physical power and technical quality that can make him seem unplayable at times. Think Michael Essien of Chelsea and Ghana.

The challenge facing the U.S. -- especially Michael Bradley and Ricardo Clark -- is to limit Palacios to a role as a bruising midfield enforcer. He's going to win challenges and deliver the kind of crunching tackles that can leave an opposing player in pieces; there's no question about that.

But he has the skill to be dangerous offensively. He's not afraid to make a dashing run into the box. And if he's allowed to dominate the midfield offensively and defensively, opening up space for Honduras' other attacking players, Americans may be in for a long, forgettable night.

None of this should make you feel better about missing Saturday night's game. Nor is it an indictment of the U.S. team's chances. But luck and circumstance are not on its side heading into Honduras, which could make for unhappy viewing. So if you're lucky enough to be able to watch the game, enjoy. But consider yourself warned. If you're like the rest of us, well, there's always Wednesday."
42,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4538569/count/41/us-national-team-coach-bob-bradley-key-lineup-decisions-make,U.S. national team coach Bob Bradley has key lineup decisions to make,"It will be interesting to see the lineup that U.S. coach Bob Bradley will send into battle in Honduras on Saturday. The inclusions of Jimmy Conrad and Clarence Goodson in his squad suggest to me that one -- Conrad is the slightly better option in my opinion -- will partner Oguchi Onyewu while Carlos Bocanegra reverts to left back. Meanwhile, Steve Cherundolo should start on the right ahead of Jon Spector, who has fallen out of favor at West Ham.

I expect Landon Donovan, Michael Bradley and Ricardo Clark to get the nod in midfield, meaning the only remaining decision concerns who is on the right in the absence of the injured Clint Dempsey. Although Stuart Holden has impressed in cameo appearances off the bench, I expect that to be his role again, with Benny Feilhaber getting the start.

Up front, it should be Jozy Altidore and Charlie Davies, although the presences of Conor Casey, Brian Ching and Kenny Cooper on the squad make me wonder whether Bradley will opt to include a target man once again, as he has in some previous road qualifiers.

Whoever is picked to do the job, the message should be ""win and you're in."" A tie or even a defeat could still result in the clinching of a World Cup spot, but hopefully there will be an emphasis on the positive in San Pedro Sula. For although few will be surprised if the U.S. clinches a place in South Africa, should it do so with a victory in what is sure to be a hostile environment, the team's reputation will receive a timely boost.

Performances since the Confederations Cup have been patchy, and a big result this Saturday would provide a timely reminder that this team might be able to make some noise in the Rainbow Nation for a second consecutive year.

A thing that made me go hmmm

While we're on the subject, the finalists for the 2009 Honda Player of the Year award were announced recently, with Altidore, Donovan and Tim Howard named on a three-man short list.

I wonder how close the voting was. All three are worthy nominees, but I am sure that the likes of Dempsey, who won the Bronze Ball at the Confederations Cup, and Davies, who has had a breakout year, also were in the running. I suppose it's a good sign that we can debate who is not on the list as opposed to who is.

The other thing I wondered about came when I saw Donovan was in line for his sixth award. Does he exchange the last Honda he won for a new one, or does he just have a very large garage?

Toronto's time is now

Although the primary focus of most American eyes will be on the national team this weekend, north of the border, the attention of Toronto FC fans will be on BMO Field, where, they hope, the start of a late-season push into the playoffs will begin.

With just nine points separating the fourth spot from the 13th in MLS, many clubs retain hope of a postseason berth, especially as most will take points off each other in the coming weeks. Thus, handicapping the closing weeks is a tricky proposition, but Toronto must be considered to have a great chance, given its run-in, which is among the most straightforward in the league.

Chris Cummins' side is home to San Jose (two road wins) this weekend and to Salt Lake (one road win) seven days later before it finishes the season at New York (four total wins). Compare its remaining schedule to that of some of its rivals. For example, New England, which has Columbus home and away with Chicago at home in between.

Three wins would take TFC to 42 points, which could be enough. Having rested for two weeks after a grueling month, in which it played five out of six games on the road, Toronto has a golden opportunity to finally clinch the playoff spot so craved by its fans.

Well played, young man

Although much of the attention following San Jose's win over New York has been devoted to the theatrics of Arturo Alvarez that led to the winning penalty, the man responsible for successfully dispatching it also is worthy of a mention.

With 10 goals and two assists from 26 games played -- as the only ever-present on the San Jose squad -- Ryan Johnson has emerged as one of the few positives from a lost season for the Earthquakes. The 24-year-old has found a home after failing to make an impression in both Salt Lake City and Chicago to the extent that, were his club pushing for a playoff spot, he might even have been garnering some attention as an outside candidate for MVP. As it is, his development is one of the reasons for San Jose fans to be cheerful heading into the 2010 season."
43,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4530607/count/41/us-u-20-team-need-new-coach,U.S. U-20 team in need of a new coach,"After watching the U.S. U-20s get thrashed by Korea 3-0 last Friday in the U-20 World Cup, I was asked if I had been surprised that the U.S. could lose in such fashion to Korea. The answer to which of course is a resounding no, not only because of the paucity of this particular pool of U-20s (more on that later), but because this is just the latest evidence that South Korea is just as accomplished a footballing nation as the U.S. is, on all levels from junior to senior.

Lest people forget, the 2007 U.S. U-20 national team, considered the gold standard for U.S. performance in U-20 World Cups, struggled badly against South Korea that year as well, and barely escaped with a 1-1 draw. As an aside, U.S. fans might also remember winger Lee Chong-Yong from that Korean squad. Lee moved to Bolton in the English Prem this summer and has made quite a splash, landing a starting job in the process.

Anyway, here's what I'm thinking post-tournament:

1. This should be the last U-20 World Cup that Thomas Rongen oversees. As I stated before the tournament began, I had very low expectations for this group of U-20s. As far as I'm concerned, any roster that's ""headlined"" by Brek Shea is one that doesn't really have the goods to compete at the international level. Having said that, failing to even qualify as one of the four best third-place finishers in the group stage is the latest indictment of Rongen's coaching, whom I firmly believe should be replaced for the next cycle.

After the previous U-20 World Cup, I wrote about how poor Rongen had been (the U.S. was carried only by standout individual performances from the likes of Jozy Altidore and Freddy Adu). Many of the issues I pointed out back then resurfaced again this time in Egypt. Once more, Rongen continued to make strange lineup choices (for example, choosing the inexperienced and overmatched duo of Brian Ownby and Dillon Powers to start in midfield against Germany). The team also lacked fluidity in its play or any real cohesive tactics outside of relying on the counterattack. Its inability to develop any semblance of build-up play or alternative plan of attack was reflected in the second half against Korea, where the only game plan seemed to be to a case of punting the ball high and far into the Korea penalty area at every given opportunity.

Granted, the 2007 U-20s were far more talented than this group, but the whole point of coaching is to maximize the talent of the squad, however limited it is. This group lacked discipline (a charge that could be leveled at the '07 group, too) and frankly appeared to give up against Korea at 2-0, even resorting to embarrassing systematic fouling.

As for Shea, perhaps I'm being a bit harsh given his age, but he still appears to be little more than a size-speed-strength prospect, the NFL draft prospect equivalent of a combine workout warrior with no instincts -- which is pretty much what he appeared to be when I first saw him at Bradenton back in 2006. The fact that U.S. coaches are still trying to develop him as some kind of attacking midfield/winger/forward and seem oblivious to his lack of technical skill or composure in the final third is mind-boggling to me. In my opinion, Shea's best (perhaps only) shot at any semblance of an effective pro career is to move to center back, or perhaps even left back. Then again, we're talking about Rongen here, who somehow deemed Neven Subotic not good enough to make the '07 U.S. U-20 squad and built the U.S. attack around Shea for this tournament, so perhaps nothing should surprise me at this point.

2. Keeping it in perspective. Having said all that, let's keep this U-20 World Cup in perspective. It's important to remember the primary, if not sole, purpose of this tournament should be to produce players for the senior national team. If even one player from this group emerges as a mainstay at the senior level, the U-20 program will have done its job. Unfortunately, this is where coaching comes into play, and why I think it's critical the USSF needs to appoint a more progressive coach for the next cycle.

3. So who could emerge with the full national team? If I were a betting man, I'd say only three or four players had any kind of shot with the senior squad, and I doubt any of them will become mainstays, or even regulars. Offensively, only Dilly Duka, Mikkel Diskerud and Bryan Arguez impressed me, and only in limited spurts at that. Ike Opara could develop into a standout MLS central defender and possibly a national team defender, but only if he refines his technique and positioning. However, I think he's still a bit overrated at this point, and largely gathering plaudits based on his size/speed and physical attributes that continue to overly enamor many of those responsible for player evaluation in this country."
44,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4525784/count/41/ryan-giggs-playing-spectacular-soccer,Ryan Giggs still playing spectacular soccer,"Ryan Giggs may be 35 years old, but he sure doesn't play like it. On Wednesday, in Manchester United's Champions League game, the winger continued to exhibit his quality as he led the Red Devils to a comeback victory over Wolfsburg, and in the process reminded us all that he is still one of the world's best players.

To be fair, Giggs was one of many outstanding performers for Manchester United. Wayne Rooney showed off his usual mix of strength and skill at the top of the attack. Dimitar Berbatov came off the bench and injected life into the squad, dropping back to create numerous scoring opportunities for teammates. Anderson controlled possession in the central midfield throughout the evening, skillfully joining the attack when needed -- the Brazilian won the free kick that led to United's equalizer. And Michael Carrick struck a fantastic curling shot to win the game 2-1. In short, it was a brilliant team effort by manager Alex Ferguson's men.

But, in my opinion, Giggs deserves the most praise due to his involvement in seemingly every dangerous opportunity created by United.

When Wolfsburg went up 1-0 early in the second half (through an Edin Dzeko goal), it was Giggs who led United's charge in search of an equalizer, getting past defenders, whipping crosses into the box and tracking back into his own half to restart attacks.

After falling behind to the Germans, it took United four minutes to draw level as Giggs found the back of the net on a set piece that took a fortuitous bounce off of a Wolfsburg defender. Fifteen minutes later, Giggs relied on pure skill and vision, not luck, to find Carrick with a simple yet perfect pass, which Carrick struck home brilliantly. Game United.

Since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, much has been made of Rooney's becoming the centerpiece of this still-talented team. Rooney has been equal to the task, scoring six goals in seven Premier League games. But in recent games, Giggs has become the backbone of the squad, serving as the critical link between the midfield and the attack. At the start of the season this responsibility had fallen on Portuguese international Nani. But Nani's struggles left the door open for Giggs, who has stepped into the role and played some of the best soccer of the season.

What I find most impressive about this Manchester United team is that it still plays very attractive soccer despite the heavy losses it suffered this summer. This is a credit to the system developed by Sir Alex Ferguson, but also to players like Giggs who have filled significant voids left by Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.

Against Wolfsburg, United's attacking skill was best exhibited in a Giggs-led buildup that took place midway through the second half. With the score tied 1-1, the winger dispossessed a Wolfsburg player in the midfield. Then, advancing the ball diagonally, from left to right, he initiated a brilliant series of overlapping, triangular exchanges between himself, Antonio Valencia, Berbatov, Anderson, Rooney and Carrick. The buildup was a superb combination of short passes and off-ball movement, and almost yielded the go-ahead score for the Red Devils.

So while there are plenty of entertaining games across Europe this weekend, I will be sure to tune in to United's Saturday fixture against Sunderland to see if the Welshman will continue to delight.

Fun games across Europe

Speaking of fun fixtures across Europe, here are three more that stand out:

In Italy on Saturday, Udinese travels to the San Siro to play an Inter team struggling at the moment. A loss to Sampdoria on Saturday dropped Inter to third in Serie A. Inter followed the disappointing domestic performance with an uninspired draw in the Champions League to FK Kazan. Udinese enters the game in excellent form, having gone undefeated in Serie A in September with wins over Milan, Genoa and Catania.

In England on Sunday, Chelsea plays Liverpool in a game that marks the first real test for Chelsea's new manager, Carlo Ancelotti. Both teams come into the match with plenty to prove, Liverpool having been humbled 2-0 at Fiorentina in the Champions League and Chelsea having suffered an embarrassing loss to Wigan on Saturday. A third league loss for Liverpool this early in the season could prove very damaging to its title hopes.

And in Spain on Sunday, Real Madrid takes on Sevilla in a game that should be filled with offensive fireworks. Madrid has overwhelmed lesser opponents so far this season on the strength of new arrivals Kaka, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. But Sevilla's potent attack, which scored four goals against Rangers this week, should test Madrid's still unproven defense. All signs point to a 3-2 or 4-3 barn burner."
45,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4518176/count/41/prelude-mls-cup-matchup,Prelude to the MLS Cup matchup?,"This weekend sees two regular-season matches that could easily be dress rehearsals for MLS Cup. First, Chicago takes on Los Angelesbefore Seattle visits Columbus a day later.

The Home Depot Center plays host to a Chicago-L.A match, which, statistically, could hardly be more evenly matched. Both are second in their conference standings. Both have 41 points. Both have records of 10-6-11. Historically, the all-time regular-season record between the two clubs is 14-14-3.

Outside team rivalries, the contest features some intriguing individual battles. For example, Brian McBride and Landon Donovan, who have a combined 168 goals and 124 assists in the regular season, will face off in MLS for the first time since 2003. Assuming both shake off injuries, Cuauhtemoc Blanco and David Beckham will go head-to-head in a battle of the DPs.

Meanwhile, in Columbus, much of the attention will be on the return of Sigi Schmid to the team he led to a championship last year. However, I am more interested to see a matchup of two South American players at opposite ends of their careers, both of whom are challenging for MVP honors.

Guillermo Barros Schelotto is the current holder of the award and, with 12 goals and three assists in 21 games this season, is in contention to become the first player to retain the prize. Among those opposing the Argentine is Fredy Montero, the 22-year-old Colombian, whose goal at New England on Saturday was his 12th of the year. Attending the game, I was keen to see him up close for the first time.

Aside from his remarkable goal, it was clear that Montero is an exceptional player who, when he is on, has the pace and touch to suggest that he has a big future on a bigger stage. However, it is also true that he must continue to polish the finer points of his game so that his influence can be even greater on matches. If he needs a role model, he can look no further than Columbus' No. 7 on Saturday.

There were times this past Saturday when Montero was too peripheral a figure. As a result, Seattle allowed New England back into a game that it had been utterly dominating for the opening 25 minutes. Not that Montero was solely responsible for this lapse but, with the Sounders having now won one in six, the need is to right the ship fast. Continued and more consistent production from their exciting young forward would help achieve that.

Bad luck, veteran man

What a mixed weekend it was for New England. Although Shalrie Joseph deservedly drew plaudits, as well as MVP consideration, for his one-man rescue act against Seattle, the enthusiasm was tempered by the news that the Revs have lost their skipper, Steve Ralston, to a season-ending knee injury.

For the second straight year -- Ralston suffered a broken leg in October -- the veteran midfielder will be sidelined for the stretch run of the regular season as well as the playoffs, and his absence is a further hammer blow to a New England squad that has been without its leading striker, Taylor Twellman, for all but 109 minutes this season.

Beyond the impact his injury will have on the Revolution in 2009, it remains to be seen what the longer-term implications are after the torn ACL suffered by Ralston in what was an innocuous-looking incident against Seattle. The road back from such a setback can be long and arduous and, considering he's 35, one must wonder when, if ever, we will see the league's all-time leader in assists, as well as games and minutes played, back on the field.

As New England coach Steve Nicol said in the aftermath of the diagnosis of his injury, Ralston cannot be replaced, and Revs fans will be hoping that this is not the end for their inspirational playmaker. The hope is that he can return to the stage he has graced for so many years, if only so he is able to depart on his own terms. Here's wishing one of the game's nice guys a speedy recovery.

A thing that made me go hmmm

Although much of the attention generated by the league's recent organizational announcements for 2010 was devoted to the two-week break MLS will take during the group stages of the World Cup, also of interest was the confirmation that each club will play a 30-game schedule next year, featuring home and away games against each of the other MLS teams.

However, don't expect the even schedule to bring with it an end to the conference system. Although a single-table format would appear logical in the short term, more distant projections of how the league will grow make such a scenario unlikely.

In 2011, the league welcomes Portland and Vancouver into the fold and, with further expansion mooted, such a system would push 24-man rosters to the breaking point. Clubs struggle enough as it is to compete in a 30-game regular season, which also features various cup competitions, and asking them to play even more games would run the risk of diluting the quality of play we see on the field.

Besides, the single table is, in a way, already here. Outside the top two in each conference, playoff berths go to the teams with the best records, regardless of their coastal affiliation. Adding teams to MLS will not hinder this system, nor will it compromise standards of play on the field."
46,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4511549/count/41/seeking-medical-opinion,Seeking medical opinion,"Three in a row was too much to ask I guess. After winning our first two games under new coach Richie Williams, we could not continue the momentum of those previous two games, and fell to Kansas City 1-0 on Sept. 12. It was a tough week leading up to the game and we were beaten up. Juan Pablo Angel was still out with a severe ankle injury, Albert Celades was nursing a leg injury and Kevin Goldthwaite was still recovering from surgery. Compounding the problem, Seth Stamler, who would play the entire game, was not 100 percent due to a groin injury.

After avoiding the training room the entire year, I went down with a lower back injury the Monday before the game. I've never had back issues, other than the occasional stiffness from playing on the artificial turf. I've played through two broken bones in my foot as well as pulled muscles throughout my career. I've always had a high pain threshold and was able to play through most injuries. Having said that, when my back went out, it made those other injuries feel like a splinter. I have never felt pain like that in my life.

The rest of the week leading up to the game was spent on the sidelines watching the rest of the team practice. It was an interesting scenario for me in that it gave me a unique perspective to witness from the outside the transformation that we have gone through in the past month. I was anxious to see if what I felt was happening, was actually happening. Under Richie, the practice ran smoothly and was specifically geared towards the way we were going to play. The guys were competitive and focused. Certain guys that had to step up in lieu of injured players were doing just that.

What can I say about the game? We didn't play the greatest first half, but were good enough to go into halftime tied. However, 10 or so minutes into the game we gifted them a goal and were never able to equalize, even though we created numerous chances in the second half. If we can take anything away from that game it's the fact that the guys worked hard and deserved to get out of there with at least a tie.

A few days after the Kansas City game, I took a 1Â½-hour drive into New York City to see our team doctor regarding my back. In fact, it was killing me so much that the team hired a car service so that I could sprawl out in the back seat to minimize the pain. I was prepared to get an MRI, x-ray, multiple shots, even sell my soul to find out what was wrong and get rid of the pain.

Upon arriving at the hospital, the doctor slipped out of surgery, still in scrubs, to see me for all of three minutes. Bend this way, now that way, cross your eyes and cough. Diagnosis: strained muscles and a possible lower back sprain. Three medications were prescribed and I was told I should be back playing within three days.

I asked the doctor (whom I like and respect) if he was taking whip-its, because the way I felt, I was a step away from a wheelchair. Well, the good ol' doc was right, because I was running around like a psycho three days later (and the muscle relaxers he prescribed were a nice touch). Primed and ready, I faced the New England Revolution on Sept. 18. The Revs are always a handful to play against. They're one of a few teams in the league that are consistent every year. You always know what to expect but can't always stop it.

Shalrie Joseph and Jeff Laurentowitz are among the best midfield combinations in MLS. They can control the ball, make accurate passes and, above all, deliver bone-crushing tackles. They, along with veteran Steve Ralston, are the core of that team. When they went up 1-0 midway through the first half, we knew it would be tough to equalize.

We kept fighting and fighting, with John Wolyniec throwing his body around with reckless abandon. It was bittersweet when he got the equalizer late in the game, because he also sustained an ankle injury that ended his season. Great play and goal, but to lose a warrior like John is tough to swallow. We followed that up with a 1-1 tie against Chivas this weekend as we continue to play spoilers to teams in the thick of the playoff race. Talk to you again soon."

Milan during the summer, it looked like a good fit for both the American international and the Italian giants. Onyewu was coming off a solid performance at the Confederations Cup and Milan was a team in need of fresh faces and depth at almost every position, including central defense. But a player revolution never came about at the San Siro, with Onyewu and striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar representing the club's only major offseason acquisitions. And while Huntelaar has been given a fair share of opportunities to prove his worth in Italy this season, Onyewu still is waiting for his chance.

Since the start of Milan's Serie A campaign in late August, Onyewu has failed to make a single appearance in a red and black jersey. To be fair, Onyewu was never going to break into the Rossoneri's starting lineup as long as it featured a healthy Alessandro Nesta and Thiago Silva. However, the American's total lack of playing time became a bit more disconcerting this past weekend when Silva went down with an injury and was replaced by veteran Kakha Kaladze, a player who doesn't exactly engender confidence. Despite Kaladze's well documented defensive shortcomings -- he scored two own goals in international duty with Georgia earlier this month, prompting some cynical fans to suggest he be converted to striker -- Milan's manager,Leonardo, chose to start the Georgian defender over Onyewu in the team's last two matches.

What is frustrating about this decision is that Silva's injury presented a good opportunity to debut Onyewu under the watchful eyes of Nesta. Nesta would have covered mistakes Onyewu made while adjusting to the new league, something the veteran already does when Kaladze is on the field. But instead of testing the waters,Leonardo chose the familiar option in Kaladze.

It's hard to blame the manager for going the conservative route, especially after Milan's 4-0 drubbing against Inter still fresh in the minds of fans. And to be fair to Kaladze, he has played relatively well in his two starts, with Milan's defense giving up one goal in those games. Nevertheless, it feels like the team may have missed an opportunity to test a potentially better defensive option in Onyewu.

From the perspective of an American fan, what is just as disturbing and frustrating as Onyewu's still-awaited debut is the seeming lack of curiosity (outside of the United States) about his ability and place on the team. When Silva went down, there seemed to be little debate in the Milan media about Kaladze's stepping in to take over, at least not in Italy -- not a good sign for those of us waiting to see what Gooch can bring to the table."
48,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4493460/count/41/can-conference-leaders-columbus-houston-hang-on,"Can conference leaders Columbus, Houston hang on?","With one month remaining in the regular season, only the Red Bulls are mathematically out of contention for the playoffs. The remaining 14 teams are all in with legitimate shots of playing into November but, in my opinion, the winner of MLS Cup will come from one of five teams.

Columbus and Houston lead their respective conferences, but with both still involved in the CONCACAF Champions League, I wonder if either can stand up to fighting on two fronts. Each side has shown signs of fatigue in recent weeks, with the Crew having won just once in the past month, while the Dynamo's victory over Real Salt Lake this past weekend was their first in five games.

Outside the top two, the other leading contenders are Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles. The Fire have been boosted by the return of Brian McBride, while, at the other end of the experience scale, Peter Lowry's late-season emergence has offset the disappointing overall output of the inconsistent Patrick Nyarko.

With three goals in its past five games, Seattle has issues of its own up front as Nate Jaqua continues to battle concussion problems. The Sounders have the quality to lift the MLS Cup but probably need their big man back up front alongside Fredy Montero if they are to do so. Three straight road games in the coming weeks will provide a pre-playoff test for Sigi Schmid's side. To win it all at home, they'll first have to succeed on the road.

Los Angeles has lost twice in the past three months and appears to be well set for a tilt at the title. Its back line has -- the 6-3 defeat to Dallas apart -- been solid while Landon Donovan and David Beckham remain the catalysts for much of what Bruce Arena's side does well offensively. Meanwhile, the display of Edson Buddle against Toronto offers further encouragement to Galaxy fans.

Hiatus status

Given the internationalization of the league in recent years, as well as the likelihood that a number of American MLS-based players will be in South Africa next year, the decision of the league to take a break during the World Cup is a sensible one. My only question is: Could it have gone even further?

As it stands, no MLS games will be played from June 10 to June 25, which encompasses the duration of the World Cup group stage. However, what remains unaffected are the weeks prior to the tournament, during which players will be away preparing with their countries, as well as those in which the knockout rounds are played. Should the U.S., for example, advance to those, MLS clubs will be without key players for longer.

The format of the MLS season, as well as the cup competitions into which many teams are entered, means that a two-week break is probably the longest that could be taken without causing a serious fixture pile-up issue. The league has shown no desire to play in winter months, so mid-March until November appears to be as long as the season can be.

It's not ideal -- teams will still miss important players for an extended period -- but by taking a break during the world's biggest soccer tournament, MLS has finally acknowledged that carrying on would be detrimental to its product on the field, which would feature teams shorn of some of their best players in front of sparse crowds as the majority stay at home to watch the action from the Rainbow Nation.

DNP, key men

Four games into the Serie A season, Oguchi Onyewu has yet to log his first minute of competitive playing time with AC Milan. The resurrection of Alessandro Nesta's career has seen the veteran re-establish himself as a starter, initially alongside Thiago Silva and, on Sunday, Kakha Kaladze, while Onyewu -- apparently the fourth central defensive option at the San Siro -- rode the bench for the third time this season.

Meanwhile, Michael Bradley continues to be out of favor at Borussia Monchengladbach, where he has not featured in a Bundesliga match since Aug. 9. He has played all 90 minutes in each of his club's two German Cup matches, but given that the latter of those was a 1-0 defeat by German second division (2. Bundesliga) club Duisburg on Tuesday, it seems likely that there will be even fewer chances to impress in competitive action for Bradley in the immediate future.

With World Cup qualifiers against Honduras and Costa Rica approaching, the continued inactivity of two men who have become major components of Bob Bradley's first-choice eleven is increasingly concerning. Unless the club fortunes of Onyewu and Bradley change in the coming weeks, the United States' coach will have to gamble on the pair or select less-experienced replacements for vital games."
49,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4491479/count/41/tough-week-americans-big-leagues,Monday Morning Musings,"Not much to speak of on the U.S. national team front as the focus switches from World Cup qualifiers back to club soccer. Here's what I'm thinking about this Monday morning from this past week's action:

1. Michael Bradley in limbo. It hasn't been the best patch in the Bundesliga for midfielder Michael Bradley. Bradley remains firmly rooted to the Borussia M'Gladbach bench, having fallen out of coach Michael Frontzeck's good graces. The team suffered a complete meltdown against Hoffenheim on Saturday (leading 2-1 late in the game only to give up three goals in the last four minutes and lose 4-2). Gladbach's next league game will be a key indicator of just how deep in Frontzeck's doghouse Bradley is. You'd have to think that after being a key performer last season, Bradley should find himself back in the starting lineup after the Hoffenheim debacle. If that's indeed the case, then this temporary benching is probably the reality check and attitude adjustment that Bradley needed. However, if he's not back in the lineup, then you have to wonder if this is the beginning of the end of his stint with Gladbach, in much the same manner that Clint Mathis' career with Hannover ended when he had the temerity to question his then-coach (who can forget the image of a feisty Mathis scoring as a sub and then running to the sideline to tap his watch at Ewald Lienen?).

2. Oguchi Onyewu rides the pine. Equally disturbing has to be the fact that Onyewu hasn't even officially seen the field for Milan yet since preseason ended. Obviously, I hadn't expected Onyewu to start over Alessandro Nesta and Thiago Silva (Thiago is considered to be one of the most gifted Brazilian center backs in years). However, when even comedy defender Kakha Kaladze is preferred over Onyewu in the starting lineup, as was the case in Sunday's 1-0 win over Bologna, U.S. fans have to be concerned about how much game time Onyewu will see if Nesta and Silva stay fit (in Nesta's case, that's a big if).

3. Jozy Altidore has a rough outing. On the flip side, Altidore is garnering minutes for Hull and started on Saturday against Birmingham. However, he was replaced in the 64th minute by Kamel Ghilas, and postgame reviews of Altidore's performance weren't the most flattering. In all honesty, Altidore did look fairly sluggish for most of the game and struggled at times (although he did have his moments), but to be fair to him, Hull didn't exactly provide the type of service that suits him. Right now, Altidore's weak spot continues to be his inability to effectively hold up play. However, Altidore certainly has the size and physical power to become an effective target man, and it's definitely something that can be worked on and improved (one only has to look at the massive strides in this respect that West Ham's Carlton Cole has made the last season and a half under Gianfranco Zola).

4. Are you serious? Speaking of West Ham, new Italian import Alessandro Diamanti made a lively start against Liverpool on Saturday and looked like he has the potential to add the flair the West Ham attack has been missing ever since Joe Cole and Paolo Di Canio departed Upton Park (does anyone seriously refer to it as Boleyn Ground?). He'll have to do some intensive work on his fitness levels, though -- if anyone doubted the difference in intensity and game speed between Serie A and the EPL, one only had to see Diamanti gasping for air by the 60th minute and begging to be taken out through sheer fatigue as opposed to injury. Diamanti also made the headlines when it was revealed that during the Hammers' trip to Wigan the week before, he'd been so dismayed by the hair dryers available to him in his hotel, he persuaded the club to courier a suitable hair dryer from London as a replacement.

5. Tottenham fails to earn its spurs. After beating Liverpool in its opening game, and racing to four straight wins out of the gate, it seemed that Harry Redknapp's men were finally ready to make their long-awaited push and challenge for the top four. However, after back-to-back thrashings by Man United and Chelsea, all that early-season optimism has faded and the club is probably looking at a struggle to finish in the top seven. Playmaker Luka Modric's injury has severely unbalanced the side (with Redknapp strangely opting to deploy a three-forward line and then Jermaine Jenas in his stead for the past two games) and his absence was notable in both losses. Compounding the problem for Redknapp is the loss of both center backs (Ledley King and Sebastien Bassong) in the game against Chelsea. An extended absence for either will see a return to Tottenham's famed defensive frailty and a continued tumble down the table."
50,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4484184/count/51/what-take-barcelona-inter,What to take from Barcelona-Inter,"It was supposed to be the best Champions League game of the week. The Inter Milan-Barcelona match offered fans a clash of European giants in an otherwise ho-hum opening round of Champions League games. Much should be expected from a match that features the champions of Spain and the champions of Italy, and these expectations should include goals. But the goals never came, as the game finished in a disappointing 0-0 draw. The scoreless draw, however, revealed a bit about both teams at this early juncture of the season.

Barcelona should not shoulder any of the blame for the score. The Barcelona midfield dominated possession, particularly in the second half, and created some good scoring chances throughout the match. The usual suspects contributed to the Catalan attack, with Lionel Messi, Xavi and Daniel Alves all creating scoring opportunities for teammates. Messi was his usual brilliant self running at defenders, getting shots on goal and setting up teammates with clever through-balls and chips. In short, it did not take long for Barcelona to remind all watching that they are still the best team in the world, a team we should all expect to see in the tournament final in Madrid next spring.

In an offseason that saw most of Europe's top clubs undergo major personnel changes, Barcelona's squad has remained largely unchanged from last season, with one notable exception (Zlatan Ibrahimovic). This is a great advantage to the Catalans, as it has allowed its players to develop a deep understanding of one another's on-field intentions, a cohesion many of Europe's best clubs currently lack. This chemistry was on display against Inter on Wednesday. All that was missing from the performance was a goal, something that can be attributed to Inter's defensive mentality as well as Barcelona's shaky finishing. Despite the goalless score sheet, Barca's ability to create a number of half-chances and near-misses in the game is a sign that this team is on the verge of hitting its full attacking potential. With Andres Iniesta now cleared to play after spending much of the summer recovering from a thigh injury, the team seems on the brink of an offensive explosion -- an unpleasant prospect for anyone scheduled to play the Blaugrana in the coming weeks.

As impressive as Messi and his teammates were on attack, they were matched by the defensive skill of Inter. Defenders Lucio, Cristian Chivu and Walter Samuel deserve praise for their outstanding performances. But Inter's conservative, Italian approach in the game has led some to criticize manager Jose Mourinho. These criticisms are unfair given the circumstances surrounding the team heading into the match. Unlike Barcelona, which experienced few personnel changes this offseason, Inter underwent a major face-lift this past summer. Samuel Eto'o and Diego Milito up front, Wesley Sneijder and Thiago Motta in the midfield, and Lucio at the back, are all new additions to the team's starting lineup. And while these new arrivals have boosted the quality of an already dangerous squad, team chemistry is still in its developmental stages as demonstrated by their inconsistent play in Serie A so far this season.

It would have been a mistake for Inter to try to match Barcelona's free-flowing play. Inter is a team still under construction, and its midfield is simply not as good as the Spanish giant's. To have played a completely open style would have left the Italian side vulnerable to a lopsided loss, an unnecessary risk for an organization under intense media scrutiny during Champions League games. Such a loss would have generated a cynical response from the media and fans, who expect Inter finally to deliver a European title this season. From a managerial perspective, Mourinho should be praised for protecting a team he is still molding. Hopefully, when the two teams meet again Nov. 24, Inter will have evolved enough under its manager to open up its play just a little more."
51,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4475866/count/51/remembering-9-11,Remembering 9/11,"Friday was the eighth anniversary of 9/11. Having been born and raised in New York, and having spent the first five years of my career playing with MLS's New York franchise, I want to share my thoughts on this with you. Something I wrote a few years ago was recently published in the Red Bulls' game day magazine, and I wanted to reprint it here. Perhaps it will bring you back to that day for a moment and make you reflect:

Just another typical weekday morning. Up at 7 a.m. Breakfast, shower and out the door at 7:30 a.m. Drop my fiancÃ©e off at the Lincoln Tunnel to catch the bus to work in NYC, then off to practice with the MetroStars. Smooth, as always, down the 1&9 against the flow of gridlock heading into the Big Apple. Past Newark Airport and into Union, N.J., ready to hit the field. Just another typical weekday morning. But as I would soon find out -- and what the entire world would realize -- was that Sept. 11, 2001, was anything but typical. It was a day of chaos, fear and confusion. Most of all, it was a day that would change our lives forever.

Eight years later, as I recall that tragic day, my emotions flow as if it had happened just this morning. I can still smell the odor of the locker room as we were informed that a plane had hit one of the towers. As we walked out to practice, I remember the shock in all of our eyes, wondering what happened, and only much later realizing that we weren't ready for the reality. Then, being called back to the locker room 15 minutes later to discover the horror that not only had the other tower been struck by a second plane, but that both had collapsed. Before even being told, we all knew this was no coincidence.

My whole world stood still as I tried to comprehend what I had just been told. Then it went into fast motion as I frantically tried to contact Kim, the woman whom I would marry a month later, who along with her father worked in New York City. She worked in midtown, across from Grand Central Station, so I was confident she would be fine because of her distance from the attacks. Her father, on the other hand, worked in an office just a stone's throw from the towers.

As the busy signal rang in my ear for the 100th time in an hour, it hit me that millions of people were making that call at the same exact moment. Only days later, when the casualties were amassing, could I understand how many people never got through, and never would. In fact, it would be more than five hours before I would hear Kim's voice, and another five before she would make it back to New Jersey. Leaving practice was another harsh reality of what had happened. With F-16s flying overhead, all roads heading north to the city were closed, with armed officers at entrance ramps.

I remember thinking, This doesn't happen in America. You only hear about this happening on the news, in other parts of the world far away from here. I headed to the house of a close friend who lived south of the city, all the while still trying to reach Kim. Upon arriving at his house, we poured a stiff drink to calm our nerves and sat on the couch watching CNN the entire afternoon, still trying to understand what had happened. It was 10 p.m. before Kim made it out of the city and to my buddy's house.

We spent a sleepless night before returning home early the next morning. We lived just outside Hoboken, N.J., on the Hudson River, and had a beautiful view of New York City and the Twin Towers from the end of our block. But the view that we returned home to was anything but beautiful, something I can't describe in words. I had spent the previous day watching the same image on TV, but it was entirely different to see it with your own eyes: still burning, the trail of smoke blowing in the wind as far as you could see. We just sat there until it became too overwhelming to take. Having been born and raised on Long Island, I knew as well as anyone that the Twin Towers were to New Yorkers what NYC is to the world: the biggest and brightest.

Later that day, I returned with my video camera to capture the devastation. I have been able to bring myself to watch it only once in eight years, but I plan on showing it to my children when they're old enough. I'm sure they'll study that day just as I studied Pearl Harbor as a high school student.

As the years have passed since that day, the old saying holds true: gone but not forgotten. To many of us, the memories run deep. Nowadays, I find it difficult to comprehend the events of 9/11 whenever the day is mentioned. Before our games, during the playing of the national anthem, the game itself becomes secondary as I listen to those great words and think about what they stand for: gone but not forgotten. That's what Sept. 11, 2001, will always be."
52,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4472474/count/51/surveying-us-team-landscape,Monday Afternoon Musings,"I'll admit to having my attention diverted by the NFL openers this past weekend, in which my team, Cincinnati (don't ask), proved once again without a doubt that if ever a team is capable of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the Bengals are golden every time.

Anyway, on to soccer, and here's what I'm thinking about this Monday:

1. The U.S. national team's lack of form. The U.S.' surprisingly hard slog through CONCACAF World Cup qualifying seems to be firmly back on track after a pair of critical wins against El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago. While credit must be given for the U.S. team's ability to grind out results, there still has to be strong concern at the U.S.' inability to impose itself and dominate play against such low-caliber opposition. U.S. players spoke after the games about not playing the way they know they can. However, I'll be honest, other than what appears now to have been a temporary blip in the Confederations Cup this summer -- the majority of the time under coach Bradley, the U.S. has played in much the same fashion as it has in the last two games. That is to say, the U.S. has trouble playing a controlled passing game through the midfield when the opposition presses, has trouble fashioning goal openings when the other team takes on a more defensive mind-set, and is still prone to alarming defensive lapses that would be normally be punished by higher-class opponents than those of CONCACAF ilk. The problem is that the U.S. remains at its best when it plays a strictly counterattacking style and tries to absorb the pressure of a team that is bringing the game to them, as was the case against Spain and Brazil. That style works even better when the U.S. manages to score first. However, I still see this team having a lot of trouble coming from a goal down against better opponents and when it's pulled out of its counterattacking posture by the need to chase a game.

2. The U.S. midfield. Just as worrying is the midfield's continuing inability to control the game. It's certainly going to be interesting to see how coach Bob Bradley plays things out once Schalke's Jermaine Jones is fit and eligible (something that continues to be up in the air given the recent news that he might need another surgery). There's no question that Jones should be the automatic choice as the starting D-mid enforcer. However, while he'll help immensely in terms of the U.S. team's ability to break up opposition attacks, he's not going to help out in terms of the moving the ball, cultured passing and controlling tempo and this is where the U.S. still has a huge shortfall. It's critical that Michael Bradley, Benny Feilhaber or Jose Torres step up and fill that void, or the potent attacking quartet of Jozy Altidore and Charlie Davies up top and Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey on the wings will go to waste. Michael Bradley in particular appears to be on cruise control as of late -- and I'm still far from convinced that he should be the nailed-on, untouchable starter that he's seemingly become. It's a real shame that the U.S. no longer has a central midfield player of the caliber of Claudio Reyna or John O'Brien to fit into the current mix.

3. The U.S. U-20s. I hate to be so seemingly down on everything this morning, but after looking at the U.S. roster for the FIFA U-20 World Cup, I can't see this team making much of a mark at the tournament. I suspect it'll be quite the uphill battle even to make it out of group stage. At this point in their careers, it's quite understandable why Jozy Altidore and Freddy Adu aren't on the squad, but their absences leave the team seriously lacking in any kind of firepower. The sheer fact that FC Dallas' Brek Shea is likely to be one of the starting forwards or see substantial playing time up top is testament to that. (As I've said repeatedly ever since first seeing Shea in action at Bradenton, his best chance to make it in Europe is probably as a central defender.) Even more worrying is that virtually half the roster (OK, I'm exaggerating a little) seems to be made up of FC Dallas reserves, who can't even regularly break the starting lineup in MLS for one of the worst teams in the league. That said, you can watch all the games in the U-20 World Cup on the ESPN family of networks. (The tourney kicks off Sept. 25 and runs to Oct. 16.)"
53,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4462506/count/51/mixed-fortunes-traditional-powers-world-cup-2010-qualifiers,Mixed fortunes for traditional powers in World Cup 2010 qualifiers,"On Wednesday, three more teams qualified for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Paraguay, Spain and England bring the grand total of known participants at next year's tournament to 10. Here's a look at a few teams that made positive or negative impressions this week:

England (Qualified)

England qualified with a victory over Croatia, rather coincidentally, given that it was Croatia that prevented England from reaching Euro 2008 with a 3-2 win at Wembley nearly two years ago. On Wednesday, the Three Lions came full circle, avenging that defeat with a 5-1 win that could have been even more lopsided.

Although the final score was a sweet sight for any England fan, even more significant was the fact that midfielders Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard scored two goals apiece. It's a noteworthy accomplishment when one considers it was widely believed at one point that the two could not be featured in the same starting lineup. Lately, this perception has begun to change, a credit to manager Fabio Capello. Capello, however, has done much more than figure out the Gerrard-Lampard question -- he also has given England a confidence and desire that sometimes were missing under past managers. At this moment, other than Spain and Brazil, I can think of no stronger team in the world.

Italy (First In UEFA Group Eight)

Wednesday's 2-0 win over Bulgaria moved the reigning world champion one step closer to qualification and should alleviate some of the pressure manager Marcello Lippi has felt in the Italian media. Of late, the Italian media have made a habit of pestering Lippi about his team selections (particularly the continued omission of forward Antonio Cassano) as well as Italy's recent scoring woes.

Fans of the Italian national team should get a better idea of how much the offense has improved in early October, when Italy travels to Croke Park to take on Ireland. That match should present a serious test for Lippi's men. A draw against Ireland will ensure World Cup qualification, but a loss would keep things interesting heading into the final qualifying game against Cyprus.

In short, there is no doubt in my mind that Italy will qualify for the World Cup. However, Italy still needs to find a consistent striker and cohesion in its midfield before it can be deemed a serious threat to repeat as champion.

Spain (Qualified)

Spain has shown no negative aftereffects from its shocking loss to the U.S. in the Confederations Cup this summer. On Wednesday, the team qualified for the 2010 tournament with a solid 3-0 win against Estonia. La Furia Roja demonstrated throughout the qualification process that they are still the class of Europe, having easily dismissed every team in their group. From the midfield up, there is no better, or deeper, team in the world. If there is one chink in the Spanish armor, it might be found in the back line, where Carles Puyol & Co. have been a bit inconsistent at times.

Portugal (Third in UEFA Group One)

Down 1-0 in Denmark, with 10 minutes left Saturday, it looked as if Portugal's qualifying hopes were about to be dealt a death blow. That is until Liedson stepped in, heading home a game-tying, 87th-minute goal that gave Portugal one point and a lifeline. On Wednesday, the team took another step toward qualification with a 1-0 win at Hungary. At the moment, there's quite a logjam atop Portugal's qualifying group as Denmark, Sweden, Portugal and Hungary are separated by just five points. With two games left, Portugal will continue to face an uphill battle in its quest to qualify for next year's tournament. Portugal must take three points from Hungary in their next match, take care of Malta, and hope Sweden or Denmark stumbles in the final qualifying games.

France (Second in UEFA Group Seven)

France continues to struggle under controversial coach Raymond Domenech. Draws against Serbia and Romania this week have left the team in a precarious second-place position in its qualifying group. With two games remaining against the likes of the Faroe Islands and Austria, it seems unlikely France will drop any further in the standings. However, it's also unlikely the French will be able to catch group leader Serbia, which currently holds a four-point edge on Les Bleus. At the moment, a second-place finish would qualify France for an eight-team playoff to Europe's final four World Cup berths (the nine group winners gain automatic qualification).

It's hard not to blame Domenech for France's current predicament. This is a deeply talented squad that should have no problem qualifying for a World Cup.

USA (First in CONCACAF)

Although the U.S. did not look overly impressive in its 1-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the victory did bring the team one step closer to World Cup qualification. The next order of business should be a top-three finish, which would mean automatic qualification. A dreaded fourth-place finish would mean taking on the fifth-place finisher out of South America in a playoff.

Mexico (Second in CONCACAF)

After hitting a very rough stretch earlier this year, one that left many questioning whether the team would qualify for the World Cup, Mexico is back on the path to South Africa. Inspired by the play of Giovani Dos Santos, El Tri has won its past four qualifying matches, which includes victories over the United States, Costa Rica and most recently Honduras. It has helped Mexico that three of its past four qualifying games have been played in the confines of the Estadio Azteca. But this past weekend, the team demonstrated that it also can win tough road games by dropping Costa Rica 3-0 in San Jose. With another home game still to be played against El Salvador and a final qualifier at Trinidad and Tobago, it's hard to imagine Mexico will finish any lower than third in the CONCACAF standings.

Argentina (Fifth place in CONMEBOL)

It just keeps getting worse for Argentina. After an embarrassing 3-1 loss to archrival Brazil on Saturday, Diego Maradona's team fell once more Wednesday, this time 1-0 against Paraguay. Although the loss to Paraguay does not eliminate Argentina from the World Cup, it does drop it to fifth place in its region and raises some serious questions about Maradona's ability to manage. A shaky defense and the lack of a pure finisher have haunted the squad of late and likely will continue to do so. Will Argentina qualify for the 2010 tournament? When one looks at the team's schedule, it seems likely that it will. But qualification will not come easy and might even involve a playoff with the fourth-place finisher in CONCACAF. An upcoming home game against Peru should go a long way toward steadying the ship, although Argentina should take nothing for granted at this point.

Brazil (Qualified)

Under manager Carlos Dunga, Brazil has undergone a significant change in philosophy. Gone is the all-out flair we've come to associate with the yellow jerseys. Instead, style has been melded with a workmanlike attitude. Despite this gritty streak, the Selecao still possess an incredible knack for attacking soccer, as demonstrated by their 3-1 thrashing of Argentina on Saturday, a win that qualified them for the 2010 tournament.

Although some might criticize Dunga for his player selections and starting lineups, the manager must be lauded for sticking with a philosophy that has allowed the team to develop an identity, something squads such as France and Argentina are still struggling to find. If pushed to pick a favorite to win next year's World Cup, I can think of no better team than Dunga's Brazil."

In that sense, given that a pair of its biggest rivals for automatic spots -- Honduras and Costa Rica -- dropped three and six points, respectively, the past four days have been very successful.

Furthermore, that the U.S. won on the road is not to be sniffed at. By winning 1-0 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Bob Bradley's side became just the third to triumph away from home in 20 matches played in this qualifying section. From this position of strength, however, weaknesses also must be assessed.

These two wins owed much to spasmodic good moments and rarely sustained quality. After the conclusion to Saturday's game against El Salvador was more frenetic than most would have predicted, once again graft, not craft, defined the performance versus Trinidad and Tobago.

Anchored by a solid display from goalkeeper Tim Howard, at least the U.S. avoided continuing its recent penchant for conceding the game's first goal. Oguchi Onyewu's return helped that, too. Although the AC Milan man has struggled at times against Kenwyne Jones, in truth there are few who do not. On the whole, Onyewu was able to restrict the forward to doing most of his work away from goal. When he did get a look, Howard was there to deny him.

Alongside Onyewu, Carlos Bocanegra grew into the game after a poor start. On the outside, the two Jonathans, Spector and Bornstein, also did their primary job of defending reasonably well to the extent that, after some early let-offs, Trinidad and Tobago created little in the penalty area other than from set pieces.

More has to come from the fullbacks, though. Most of the elite teams in the world feature attacking outside defenders who are as comfortable in the opponents' final third as in their own. Wednesday night, I noticed that it was not until the 35th minute when Bornstein first gained possession deep in T&T's half. Crosses have to come from sources other than just Landon Donovan.

A fundamental reason attacking fullbacks are so important is the narrow look that the U.S. midfield has with both Donovan and Clint Dempsey. Both players, though nominally wide players, look to cut inside at every opportunity. The U.S. must take better advantage of space created, and if their fullbacks do it, they'll produce greater numbers in attacking areas.

Although the goal came from good work by Donovan and not a fullback, an example of this was seen Wednesday. As the ball was laid back to Ricardo Clark, five white shirts were in the home penalty area, an overloading that resulted in scrambling defenders struggling to cover, thus presenting Clark with the time and space to get away his goal-bound shot.

Finding more ways to link the midfield and forwards has to be an ongoing priority for this team. Jozy Altidore and Charlie Davies' partnership continues to grow, but the speed and skill of the pair remains likelier to create chances than any consistent interaction with the midfield. As Wednesday's winner showed, when those combinations are put together, the results can be impressive.

Well played, young men

Benny Feilhaber and Stuart Holden impressed in their roles off the bench and provided reminders to a number of regulars that few outfield positions on this team can be taken for granted.

Two players who may need to look over their shoulders, based on current form if not reputation, are Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey. The former was better on Wednesday than against El Salvador, possibly thanks to the security-blanket effect that the defensive-minded Clark provided in front of the back four. During the next month, Bradley needs to reassert himself in Borussia Monchengladbach's first XI while learning from some of the adversity he has faced recently.

Dempsey's case, meanwhile, is more curious. Established as a starter at Fulham and fewer than three months removed from winning the bronze ball at the Confederations Cup, he since has struggled to influence internationals consistently. His goal on Saturday reminded us of his value, but besides that highlight, we've seen little of the verve and energy we have come to expect from him, especially in midfield. Instead, he has shown more encouraging signs further forward, where the emphasis is more on facing the opposing goal than his own.

Barring injury, it is unlikely that either Bradley or Dempsey will be omitted from the starting lineup in Honduras on Oct. 10. Both are fine players who have proved their worth at this level, having become automatic starters under Bob Bradley during a successful run for the national team.

However, if the push from the likes of Feilhaber, Holden and others on an ever-deepening depth chart does not see them improve their games, the clamor for changes will increase. With the reward of playing a major role in South Africa on offer, these should be no times for resting on laurels.

A thing that made me go hmmm

Bob Bradley rarely cracks a smile on the touchline, but there was a slight curling of the lips when, after the final whistle in Port of Spain, he asked Trinidad and Tobago coach Russell Latapy to ""knock off one of the big boys."" It is nice to see that it is not just the fans who study the schedule to see where rivals may drop points.

With no more than pride to play for, what can be expected from the Soca Warriors in their remaining two games -- away against Costa Rica and at home facing Mexico -- may not amount to much. However, if Latapy's men put in the effort they showed against the United States and are a little more fortunate with their luck in front of the goal, Bradley's wish just might be granted."
55,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4451988/count/51/room-improvement-us-team,Room for improvement for U.S. team,"In his postgame comments on Saturday, U.S. coach Bob Bradley spoke of how pleased he was with the way his team fought back from falling a goal behind to El Salvador, adding that at ""this point in qualifying ... it's not about how it looks. One team gets three points at the end of the game. And it better be you.""

Good points though they have been, the overriding feeling I have had since the final whistle blew at Rio Tinto Stadium is that this is another game after which many questions remain. Against a nation ranked 74 places below them, the Americans emerged with a narrow victory that owed much to individual moments of ability rather than a cohesive, consistent performance.

When they were needed, Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore came up big in front of goal, with Landon Donovan playing a fine hand in support. Meanwhile, Tim Howard made a big stop in the closing minutes. There were other good moments, of course, but for almost every one, there was a panicky clearance or a tame surrender of possession.

In Port of Spain on Wednesday, Bradley's men face a Trinidad & Tobago side for which nothing less than victory will do if it is to retain hopes of a spot in South Africa. A desperate team is a dangerous team, and the U.S. must be on its guard if it is to avoid another nerve-racking night. For this to happen there are, in my opinion, three main areas in which things must improve:

1. Onyewu's return. The mainstay of the American back line, Onyewu's absence was felt throughout Saturday's match. His return is important, not only because he is the best-equipped of the defenders at Bradley's disposal to deal with the physical threat posed by Kenwyne Jones, but also because his presence should allow Carlos Bocanegra to return to left back in place of Jonathan Bornstein, whose offensive qualities are not yet sufficient to offset the issues he has closer to his own goal.

That Onyewu's last competitive game was on Aug. 12 in Mexico -- he has yet to make his Serie A debut for AC Milan -- is a slight concern, but he remains an automatic pick when available and will play in tandem with Jay DeMerit if the Watford man can recover from a groin injury.

2. Preaching possession. The U.S. game plan on Saturday was the right one. An emphasis on getting forward at speed and in numbers was the best way to get at an El Salvador side yet to shut an opponent out in this round of qualifying. The issue was that it was not well-executed, with too many attacks frittering out due to mistakes that saw possession relinquished and led to counterattacks that pressurized the American back line. As Clint Dempsey said after the game, ""We pushed so much forward to put the game away we left ourselves a little bit exposed.""

More care must be taken with the ball throughout the team, and there will be a particular onus on those in central midfield to be more cautious when they attack to ensure that, if an offensive does break down, there is adequate cover behind them. Given this, it would be no surprise to see Ricardo Clark's more defensive outlook preferred to Benny Feilhaber.

3. Changes up front?

Meanwhile, don't be surprised to see Brian Ching in the lineup on Wednesday. Charlie Davies' calf problem may make Bradley's selection poser simpler, but even if the Sochaux striker is passed fit, I have a feeling that his may be a role off the bench against the Soca Warriors, as it was (to goal-scoring effect) last October.

Ching's ability to hold the ball up and win free kicks is not underestimated by his coach, especially since, in recent times, most U.S. goals have come from set pieces and crossed balls. Though Ching will continue to have his critics, he remains a viable option -- in the same way that Emile Heskey is seen as a key player for England -- especially on the road where drawing the sting from the home team and its fans is so important.

A thing that made me go hmmm

On Wednesday, in order to move closer to a place in South Africa, Bradley's side will have to do something that only two other CONCACAF nations have managed through seven rounds of qualifying: win a game on the road.

To date, Honduras, the U.S. and Mexico have 100 percent winning home records while El Salvador also remains unbeaten in its own backyard. By winning in Costa Rica on Saturday, Mexico joined the Ticos, who won in Port of Spain in June, as the only nation to win an away game. Who said CONCACAF qualifying was easy?

Another thing that made me go hmmm

New England and Kansas City really don't like each other, do they? In the last four games between the two sides, five red cards have been shown, and three of those have been for serious foul play.

It is probably no coincidence that the breaches of discipline have come about following a contentious match last October in which Revolution captain Steve Ralston suffered a broken leg in a challenge with Herculez Gomez. Two weeks later, then-Revolution winger Khano Smith saw red for a hideous two-footed lunge at the Kansas City man.

This season, Emmanuel Osei, Lance Watson and Shalrie Joseph have all been sent for early baths by referees who, no doubt mindful of past issues between the two teams, have gone to their pockets in attempts to alleviate future issues. It's fair to say that, to date, it hasn't really worked...

Well-played, young man

While he remains very much unproven at the international level, Conor Casey continues to put up numbers in MLS that will see him receive some serious consideration for MVP honors if Colorado makes the playoffs.

Having been released from the national team squad following the removal of his wisdom teeth, things did not begin too well for Casey on Sunday against his former club when his first-half penalty rattled the Toronto crossbar. But things soon improved when, seven minutes after halftime, he headed Colorado into the lead.

Omar Cummings collected his 11th assist of the season on the goal. Cummings is the other member of arguably the most in-form strike partnership in the league. While Casey leads MLS in scoring with 12 goals, Cummings is the only player with double digits in assists."
56,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4448100/count/51/crucial-qualifiers-portugal-argentina,Crucial qualifiers for Portugal and Argentina,"For much of the summer I've ignored the possibility that next year's World Cup could be played without two of the world's top players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. But with World Cup qualifying games set to resume this weekend, it's hard to ignore the precarious qualifying positions of both Ronaldo's Portugal and Messi's Argentina. So, as we head into the weekend, let's take a look at the challenges facing both national teams.

Excuse the clichÃ© but if the World Cup started today, Portugal would find itself on the outside looking in. This is largely due to the team's inconsistent play and inability to pick up wins against lesser opponents. Ronaldo & Co. currently occupy the third position in UEFA's Group One standings, four points behind second-place Hungary and seven points behind group leader Denmark.

The good news for Portugal is that it plays both Denmark and Hungary in the coming days and a couple of wins would catapult Portugal back into the mix. The bad news is both games are on the road and a loss in either match will deal a severe blow to the squad's qualifying hopes. While Portugal no doubt has the talent to pull off two victories during this tough stretch, I just don't think the team has demonstrated consistent enough play to make it a reality.

Like Portugal, Argentina has struggled of late under manager Diego Maradona. Losses to Ecuador and Bolivia earlier this year dropped the team into fourth place in the CONMEBOL standings. And while Messi's men are in a much better position than Ronaldo's squad -- fourth place in South America still means automatic qualification to next year's tournament -- a loss this weekend to group leader Brazil, paired with an Ecuador win, would greatly complicate their qualification bid. Should this scenario play out, Argentina would drop into fifth position, out of automatic qualification and requiring a playoff game, with only three qualifying games left to make up ground.

It's hard to imagine that Argentina, with all its attacking talent, will not figure out a way to beat Brazil at home. Nevertheless, I expect the game to be a struggle as Brazil has developed a tough, workmanlike streak under manager Carlos Dunga. When one takes into account Argentina's suspect defense, it may only take one offensive burst out of Brazil, from the likes of Kaka or Robinho, to steal a win -- a result that could send its archrivals into a tailspin.

Enjoy a great weekend of soccer."
57,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4436853/count/51/mike-petke-says-new-york-red-bulls-riding-high-starting-over,Mike Petke says New York Red Bulls are riding high after starting over,"When you last heard from me we had just been eliminated from the Champion's League and were on our way to achieving the worst record in MLS history. A week later, despite having numerous chances and limiting Chivas to few opportunities, we lost again, 2-0 at home. Let's rewind two months back and I will let you in on some things ...

Our general manager, Erik Stover, was summoned to Austria by our owners to explain to them what the problem is with the New York Red Bulls. Now, I have no idea what was said in that meeting, but speculation was being thrown around the locker room like gossip in a junior high cafeteria, with the majority believing we would have a new coach by the end of the week.

Upon his return, our GM held a meeting to state that there would NOT be a coaching change. So it was back to work to prepare for the Champions League with our coach secure. Well, you already know what happened, so I would prefer not to rehash the outcome.

Now fast forward to Aug. 21. Just another practice for the Red Bulls in Montclair, N.J. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Same warm-up, same passing drills, then on to a 9 versus 9 scrimmage. Coach Juan Carlos Osorio was his usual self. Nothing felt different. However, upon returning to the locker room we were informed that our GM was there and we would be having a meeting. I didn't think much of it because we have meetings all the time. When we were all gathered in the meeting room and ready to start, Osorio walked in and, with a few words, resigned. He thanked us for our hard work, wished us well and walked out. The place was silent. And so a new season started at that moment.

Our longtime assistant, Richie Williams, was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season and had one day to prepare us for our game against Dallas. He stood up and spoke. I can't tell you exactly what he said, but I can tell you that they were the right words. Everyone walked out of that meeting knowing what was expected of them and that every game remaining is a final.

Our goal is simply to win eight finals to end the season. The practice the next day, our last one before the Dallas game, was fast-paced and enthusiastic. Whenever there is a change at the top, it's only natural that a spark ignites within the players. Richie gathered us at the end and went over the game plan once more, and we were done with our first practice of the new season.

Arriving to the stadium on game day was bittersweet for me. I was excited at what was most likely going to be a great day but pissed because I was not going to be a part of it. I was suspended due to yellow card accumulation. I was stuck in the team box to watch the game. At least they had some tasty food and beer that I was tempted by -- what's a sporting event without a couple of cocktails? I have been advised by my attorney to state the following: For the record, not one drop of that smooth, refreshing, cold beer touched my lips.

Anyway, the game went as expected: a 3-2 win and our first since mid-May. Watching from above, I found myself completely engrossed in the same passion that I feel when I am actually on the field, jumping up when we scored and cursing in disgust when we were scored on. It was surreal to watch all 11 players play with urgency and a bite that I haven't seen in a long while. The locker room was loose and happy after the game. Not only had we won, but we scored three goals to do it, something we hadn't done since our last win on May 8 when we put four on the board against San Jose.

Next up, the Columbus Crew, who were riding high on a 20-game unbeaten streak. The week of practice leading up to the match was very intense and mapped out to how we were going to play. I was excited to be done with my suspension and ready to be a part of the ""New Era.""

On game day, I felt like a rookie getting ready for my first game. I got to the stadium early and couldn't wait to get started. From the opening whistle, I was relieved to feel the same intensity that I experienced while watching the week before. However, Columbus is a team that has 11 players who fight for every ball for the entire 90 minutes. A lot of the Crew's wins haven't necessarily been through well-played soccer but, rather, their commitment to fight and do whatever it takes to come out on top.

A few things I remember from the game: I was elbowed in the head five times (that I can remember), with most of them happening within feet of the linesman. I finally yelled to the linesman, ""Are you seeing this?"" His response was confusing. He kept telling me that he sees what's happening. What the hell does that mean? If you see it, call it! Love those refs.

However, what I remember the most is watching Seth Stammler give an extra effort and blocking a shot that rebounded to Dane Richards inside our half of the field. Richards collected it and turned on the jets, outsprinting two players to create a 2-on-1 break. I watched from behind as he slowed at the top of the Crew's 18-yard box, faked left, cut right and hit a quick shot inside the left post for a 1-0 lead. Dane scored a great goal, but it wasn't possible without the extra effort of Seth Stammler. For the remainder of the game they pressed hard but with every wave of an attack, we fought hard and, more importantly, left everything we had out on that field. Two wins in a row after two months of absolute misery. It feels great but we have a few more finals to go ..."
58,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4429041/count/51/first-big-derby-season,First big derby of the season,"The first big derby of the European soccer season takes place Saturday as A.C. Milan hosts Inter Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. To be honest, it's beyond me why this game is being played during the second week of an unripe season, when many Italians have just returned from -- or, in many cases, are still on -- their August vacations. The poor scheduling choice may temper national excitement for a game that should be one of the jewels on the Serie A calendar.

Regardless of this unfortunate scheduling, the Milan derby is one of the world's best, and I expect the San Siro to be energized by Rossoneri fans, who must be feeling good after their team's win at Siena. In that opener, Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato demonstrated a good understanding of each other, the former setting up the latter for both Milan goals. The 2-1 win has generated much excitement in the Milan camp, particularly from team owner Silvio Berlusconi, who gushed after the game that Pato was more valuable than the recently departed KakÃ¡. Berlusconi also asserted that he would not trade Ronaldinho for any player in the world. A little over-the-top after beating a team that finished 14th in the standings last season.

Looking ahead, Milan should greatly benefit from playing an Inter team that is still tinkering with its lineup this early in the season. Against Bari last weekend, Inter manager Jose Mourinho mixed his strike force throughout the game. Despite the lineup experimentation, Inter played very well and was unlucky to come away with only a draw in its opener. New signings Samuel Eto'o and Diego Milito showed good chemistry, and second-half sub Ricardo Quaresma created a handful of chances upon his entry. Inter's key to victory, however, will be the play of right back Maicon. The left side of Milan's defense is vulnerable, and I believe Maicon will give the Rossoneri fits, as he did last season. Anything can happen in this derby, but I like Inter to find its stride and pull out a 2-1 win.

Arsenal's big test



Arsenal face a big test as the Gunners travel to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United on Saturday. So far this season, Arsene Wenger's men have impressed, scoring a ton of goals in both the Premier League and the Champions League. Scoring prowess does not necessarily yield titles, but should this ever-young team grab an early-season win against Manchester United, it may serve as the catalyst to a league title run. The absence of Rio Ferdinand at the center of the defense has to be of concern to United fans, especially with all the offensive firepower Arsenal will bring to Old Trafford.

Nevertheless, I have a sneaking suspicion Manchester United will withstand the Arsenal attack with Jonny Evans and Nemanja Vidic manning the back line, and pull out a very tight victory.

Blurring National Lines



It looks like Juventus striker Amauri is about to become an Italian citizen after stating in a recent interview that he expects his Italian passport to arrive in the mail any day now. The Brazilian-born player has been linked with a call-up to the Italian national team for some time, and now that his citizenship seems imminent, it should not be long before Italy manager Marcello Lippi calls him up to an Italy side in desperate need of a quality striker. This whole saga has been a strange one, with Amauri seemingly offering his services to both Brazil and Italy, as a free agent would to professional teams. To be fair, there is nothing unusual or new about a player choosing to play for one national team over another.

In fact, 50 years ago it was not uncommon to have a player join one national team, then a second and, on occasion, even a third. The great Italian-Brazilian striker Jose Altafini, for example, played first for Brazil and then for Italy before the rules of the game disallowed such shifting allegiances.

Should Amauri finally play for the Azzurri, it is sure to cause an uproar among purists who believe bloodlines and/or birth play a critical role in determining national representation on the field. I am not here to pass judgment for or against this possible move. I simply find it an interesting example of the complexity of international soccer.

Every international soccer tournament offers fans a chance to express national identity. In World Cup years, especially, so much of the media coverage focuses on the patriotic spectacle of the event. Yet while the international game does provide an outlet for national identity, a case like Amauri's also complicates, and at times blurs, national distinctions."

Even after Chivas USA opened the season with seven wins in nine games, many observers remained unconvinced that this was a squad capable of winning the Western Conference. Key men had either moved on or been sidelined by injuries or lack of form. It was speculated that those who did show early form were incapable of maintaining their high level of play.

Sure enough, the breathless beginning gave way to an inconsistent middle stretch of the season, which, in turn, was the catalyst for a run of five straight defeats immediately before and after the All-Star break. All of a sudden, there were whispers about Preki's job security amid general concerns that the early-season work was going to waste.

Fortunately, a trip to New York -- where many a losing streak has gone to die -- was scheduled and, following a 2-0 win, Chivas continued to build momentum with an identical result against Toronto. With games in hand on every other team in its conference, things are suddenly looking up for the Goats.

Two big games this week will tell us much about whether this newfound optimism will last. First, while Real Salt Lake has been starved of consistency itself, at home it is formidable, having lost once in 11 games at Rio Tinto Stadium. Chivas, with just seven road goals all year (and one in the four games prior to the victory in New York), will be tested.

Three days later is another road game, though at least there is no travel involved as Chivas meets the Galaxy (live on ESPN2) in the final regular-season SuperClÃ¡sico of 2009. Preki's side failed to score in either of the two previous meetings, tying 0-0 in April before losing 1-0 in July.

Although no team has conceded fewer goals this season, only two -- Kansas City and New York -- have scored fewer that Chivas, and fans must be hoping that Sacha Kljestan's return to form against Toronto is a sign of things to come. Having let the disappointment of not getting a move to Celtic translate into his play for too long, the midfielder is finally showing why the Scottish giant took an interest in him in the first place.

With a strong defense behind him and a little more help up front -- Maicon Santos' debut display bodes well -- Kljestan could provide a spark to fire Chivas into the postseason. We'll know more by Sunday.

A thing that made me go hmmm



The Peter Vermes era in Kansas City continues to stall. Having taken charge of the team following the firing of Curt Onalfo, Vermes staked his own reputation on getting the best out of an underperforming squad, which he himself has played a major part in building.

Two games into the reclamation project, a return of two defeats and zero goals scored (from 28 shots taken) suggests that, no matter who is in charge of this Wizards squad, there is no magic wand to turn their fortunes around. Vermes has tried tinkering with things -- only five of the starters in Onalfo's last game have since retained their spots -- but to no avail.

As I write, Kansas City is nine points adrift of a playoff spot, and Saturday's home game against Real Salt Lake is followed by five of seven on the road. Vermes clearly felt he could do a better job than Onalfo, and though all is not yet lost -- the Wizards have games in hand on those above them -- the early signs are that his move from front office to bench will have little impact.

Well-played, old man



What a shame it is that arguably the best goal scorer in MLS is playing for the league's worst team. On Sunday against FC Dallas, Juan Pablo Angel twice demonstrated that, while most things around him may be on the decline, his powers certainly are not.

Angel's second goal on Sunday was his 42nd in just 68 matches for the Red Bulls and catapulted the Colombian past Giovanni Savarese into first place on the franchise's all-time scoring list. As a season comes to a close in which virtually nothing has gone right in New York, Angel remains a shining light amid a sea of gloom."
60,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4418779/count/61/mulling-us-roster-2010,Monday Morning Musings,"OK, after a brief break in Boston, I'm back in the office (although I'm about to head off on vacation later this week) and with the European leagues in full swing, there's a bunch of things to talk about. Here's what I'm thinking about today:

1. Projected U.S. World Cup roster: Since we launched our first U.S. player power rankings last month, I've gotten a lot of e-mails asking me to clarify if the rankings represent how we at ESPNsoccernet perceive the players, or if we're trying to represent what we think coach Bob Bradley thinks.

The answer is the latter: It's our projection as to whom Bradley will choose for his World Cup squad in 2010, and it's more or less an amalgamation of our staff writers' opinions and discussions with team sources. On the flip side of that, people have asked me whom I would choose for the 23-man squad. Working on the premise that the World Cup was starting this week, and assuming that everyone is healthy, here's whom I'd pick:

Goalkeepers (3): Tim Howard, Brad Guzan, Troy Perkins.

Defenders (8): Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit, Carlos Bocanegra, Jonathan Spector, Steve Cherundolo, Frankie Hejduk, Edgar Castillo, Chad Marshall.

Midfielders (8): Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Benny Feilhaber, Stuart Holden, Jose Torres, Maurice Edu, Jermaine Jones, Robbie Rogers or Freddy Adu.

Forwards (4): Charlie Davies, Jozy Altidore, Brian Ching, Landon Donovan.

Just to explain some of my choices, I've opted for only 3 pure forwards because both Donovan and Dempsey can also play forward, and I don't think the remaining choices like Conor Casey or Kenny Cooper are compelling enough to merit taking over some of the names in the midfield pool.

I'm fully aware that neither Rogers nor Adu has proven himself at the senior level, but I still believe that the team needs an X factor option off the bench, someone who can offer something different, who's direct with his play and capable of beating defenders off the dribble. That being the case, I'd opt for whoever is in better form leading into the World Cup out of the duo of Robbie Rogers and Freddy Adu.

As for the troublesome left back spot, I've opted to take only one pure left back -- and admittedly a gamble at that -- in Edgar Castillo, who offers a lot more going forward than Jonathan Bornstein. With Spector able to fill in at left back, and Bocanegra capable of playing there (against certain opposition), that's enough cover for a position that remains extremely weak.

2. Landon Donovan's next projected move to Europe: This time, reports have surfaced on French soccer Web site Le10sport.com that Paris Saint German are negotiating with Donovan's reps to bring him to the French Ligue (other teams rumored to be interested are Espanyol, Livorno and Genoa). My initial feelings are positive that it'd be a good move for him. For a start, U.S. fans must be relieved that it's not the Bundesliga again. Also, PSG is a quality club, which, while far below the level of its heyday, still plays attractive enough football in an attacking league that will suit his game. However, fans shouldn't expect Donovan to waltz straight into the starting lineup; PSG has a fair amount of attacking midfield/forward talent.

Donovan will be competing with the likes of Stephane Sessegnon, Ludovic Giuly, Mevlut Erdinc, Guillaume Hoarau and Peguy Luyindula for playing time. It's likely that he'll see far more playing time than he did at Bayern, but he's by no means assured of a starting spot.

3. Jozy Altidore off to a fast start: After Altidore came on and proved to be one of the keys in Hull's victory over Bolton, you'd have to think that he's locked down a starting spot ahead of Hull's other more pedestrian forwards (the utterly useless Caleb Folan and Craig Fagan, for example). Altidore assisted on the game-winning goal, looked dangerous throughout his 30-minute run and could easily have scored two or three goals (he almost certainly should have finished his one-on-one with Jussi Jaaskelainen, which he lofted inches wide).

It's not always going to be this easy for Altidore -- there were a lot of gaps in the Bolton back line as they chased the deficit -- but after that performance, fans can expect plenty more opportunities for Altidore to strut his stuff. These are certainly exciting times for U.S. fans who've long been hoping for a striker who can hit in the double-figure range in a top league. With Charlie Davies and Altidore progressing rapidly, the U.S. could very well have two such players available heading into the next World Cup -- all of which should put further pressure on Bob Bradley to keep his two most explosive strikers in the lineup at the same time.

4. Chad Johnson's ode to soccer: OK, so while he officially goes by Ochocinco these days, the Bengals wide receiver has long been not only a devoted soccer aficionado (as he outlined to me when I interviewed him back in 2007) but also an accomplished player in high school. Those unaware of his soccer skills were treated to a display of his leg strength when he filled in for injured Bengals kicker Shayne Graham on Thursday against New England in a preseason game. It's just another reminder of how much scarier the U.S. team could potentially be if it could entice more of its top-flight athletes to stick with soccer.

5. MLS vs. ESPN Part II. Last Wednesday we played our annual staffer match (7-a-side) between MLS and ESPN. A bunch of us from Bristol headed down to Manhattan and met up with a couple of our New York marketing staffers to face MLS in a rematch of last year's game (won by MLS 7-6). This time we played at the outdoor field turf pitch next to Chelsea Piers on W.23rd and the signs were ominous beforehand. MLS director of communications Will Kuhns (who unfortuntely for MLS was unable to play) suggested we mix the teams up in order to promote parity (probably due to the fact that the MLS lineup appeared to be a lot younger than ours and boasted 4 former D-1 college players). We respectfully declined out of company pride, determined to win or lose on our own merit (or lack of). However, since we only had 7 players, MLS did graciously give us two of their players, one to be our goalie, the other, one of their D-1 female players. The result? We surprisingly won handily 10-6 and I notched three goals. The taste of revenge is sweet!"
61,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4413970/count/61/this-liverpool-year,This could be Liverpool's year,"It's amazing what a blowout win will do for your season's outlook. After an anemic loss to Tottenham in the opener, which left some questioning the team's title chances, Liverpool came out on fire in a 4-0 victory over Stoke on Wednesday. Led by a tireless Steven Gerrard, who assisted on two of his team's scores (the second set up by a fantastic move), and new signing Glen Johnson, Liverpool looked like a squad that could finally bring home that elusive 19th English league title.

Of course, the Reds are not flawless and there will be many obstacles to overcome in their quest for a championship. The team's most pressing issue at the moment is the loss of central defender Martin Skrtel, who will be out for two weeks with a cracked jaw. This means more playing time for 18-year-old Daniel Ayala, who looked good in his first start against Stoke. The other more long-term dilemma is finding a suitable replacement in the midfield for the departed Xabi Alonso. Thus far, Lucas Leiva has performed admirably, though in an unspectacular fashion while filling in for Alonso.

However, if the Brazilian fails to deliver quality performances, manager Rafa Benitez could eventually turn to summer signing Alberto Aquilani after he recovers from ankle surgery. Going with Aquilani, however, may prove an even riskier move than playing Lucas. While I have high hopes for Aquilani, he was inconsistent at Roma, never reaching his full potential. Furthermore, he will need time to adjust to the English league, something you cannot afford in the middle of a title race.

Despite these question marks, I'm picking Liverpool to win the Premier League this season. And while Gerrard and Fernando Torres need to be the protagonists in any title run made by the Reds, more brilliant performances from Johnson will go a long way toward bringing a title to Anfield. Johnson is a superstar. OK, maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit, but the right back has been a joy to watch in his first two games this season. An absolute dynamo up the right wing, he is one of the reasons I am jumping on the Liverpool bandwagon. With the talented Yossi Benayoun adding a needed dimension to the left side of the midfield and the toughness of Javier Mascherano in the middle of the pitch, I can't help but feel this is the year for Liverpool fans.

Inter to dominate Serie A ... again

Serie A gets under way this weekend, so here's a look at Italy's Big Three:

Inter: While I would like to say that this season's scudetto race promises to be an exciting one, I just cannot picture any team outside of Inter winning the title. Inter enjoyed the best summer transfer period of Italy's top contenders and must again be considered the favorite to win the league. The Nerazzurri have added a wealth of talent to a team that was already Italy's best, including strikers Samuel Eto'o from Barcelona and Diego Milito from Genoa. Look for Inter to pair the newly arrived strikers at the top of its attack while finding ways to get youngster Mario Balotelli more playing time throughout the season. Inter also strengthened its defense this summer, with the addition of Brazilian center back Lucio. There is a rightful criticism that the team lacks a creative force in the midfield. However, this creative deficiency has not stopped them from winning the Italian league four years running, so why should anything change now? I think Inter will once again prove to be Italy's most consistent team, and barring some pressure from Juventus, I expect Jose Mourinho's squad to earn its 18th Italian title, a significant achievement that would best city rival Milan by one.

Juventus: Juventus is the only real threat to Inter's title run this season. The arrival of Diego, who has impressed in the preseason, will add creativity to the Juve attacking third. The ageless Alessandro Del Piero can still put the ball in the back of the net and deliver a touch of magic when needed. And if Sebastian Giovinco continues to come into his own, he will offer a nice attacking option off the bench. Juve also possesses a strong defense led by center back Georgio Chiellini, and two quality fullbacks in Zdenek Grygera and Paolo De Ceglie who can advance the ball up the wings. Interestingly enough, the wild card in the back four is Fabio Cannavaro, who returns to Juventus after a three-year stint at Real Madrid. Cannavaro's quality has dipped since his heroics at the 2006 World Cup, and while a return to Serie A likely will do him some good, it is hard to ignore the fact that he is now 35 years old and most likely in the twilight of his career. So, while Juventus is no doubt talented, with an interesting mix of experience and youth, I do not think the club has the horses to take home the title this season. Nevertheless, Juve will push Inter.

A.C. Milan: Milan has been an incredible disappointment to its fans this summer, both in the transfer market and in their preseason performances. While getting Oguchi Onyewu addressed a lack of depth in central defense, the arrival of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar seemed a bit forced, a move made to appease angry fans as much as for tactical reasons. To be blunt, while Huntelaar is a talented player, he is not what this team needed. The truth is, Milan is old and lethargic, particularly in the midfield, and the loss of Kaka this offseason will only underline this sluggishness. And while some have talked about a Ronaldinho renaissance at the club, I simply cannot buy it. The player we all enjoyed watching at Barcelona is, in all likelihood, gone forever. This is not to say he can no longer play at a high level. Ronaldinho still shows flashes of brilliance, but anyone expecting him to carry Milan to a Serie A title is dreaming. That responsibility and those expectations should fall to his fellow countryman Alexandre Pato, one of the few players capable of injecting energy into this Milan squad. Milan fans should be happy with a third-place finish. And while I expect the club to qualify for the Champions League, it will be a battle as there is a good chance the Rossoneri could finish behind a team like Genoa, Napoli, Roma or Fiorentina.

Sleeper team to watch

Napoli: While Roma, Lazio and Fiorentina could all impress this season, I encourage Serie A viewers to keep an eye on Napoli. The addition of striker Fabio Quagliarella bolsters an attack that already features talented forward Ezequiel Lavezzi and attacking mid Marek Hamsik. Youngster Fabiano Santacroce should continue to come into his own at center back this season, further strengthening the Azzurri defense.

This summer, there was much speculation that Lavezzi and Hamsik might leave, but the team managed to hold on to both players. Another good season out of the two likely would ensure their departure next summer, so there is a great deal of pressure on Napoli to win now. Napoli always presents a challenge to any opponent, particularly at San Paolo Stadium, where last year they were 2-0-1 against Inter, Juventus and Milan. I expect this team to qualify for next year's Europa Cup and would not be surprised to see them sneak into a Champions League spot at season's end.

Player to watch

Antonio Cassano: With the departures of Kaka and Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- and Francesco Totti and Del Piero no longer in the prime of their careers -- Antonio Cassano has arguably become the best player in Italy. In fact, I would say that on pure talent alone, there is no one better in Serie A than Cassano. If you have a chance to watch him play for Sampdoria this season, please do so. The man is a little genius as well as an emotional powder keg -- one of the reasons he never gets called up to the Italian national team -- so you're bound to be entertained no matter what. Reports out of Italy suggest that Cassano trained particularly hard this offseason, which is evident in his preseason performances thus far. I expect another big season from the Sampdoria man, his best one yet since his return to the peninsula from his failed stint with Real Madrid.

62,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4409062/count/61/seattle-stepping-right,Seattle stepping up at the right time,"Seattle conquers its road woes

In preparing for this week's blog, I had expected to be writing about how Seattle's excellent first season in MLS was in danger of being undermined by its road form. After all, heading into Saturday's game at Los Angeles, the Sounders were winless away from Qwest Field since early April, a stretch of eight games.

Well, so much for that! Having been shutout for three straight games, the Sounders cooled the Western Conference's hottest side and quietly -- given the attention of the Galaxy's star men -- indicated that they have what it takes to get the important road results and sustain a deep postseason run.

They certainly have the coach to take them into the postseason in Sigi Schmid, who appears to have the players' support. At this stage of the season, depth is eminently important, and it played a vital role in Seattle's latest win, considering it was without key men Jhon Kennedy Hurtado and Freddie Ljungberg.

With Houston set to be tested by a schedule that features Champions League play in addition to MLS games, the Dynamo's seven-point lead in the West is certainly not insurmountable. Furthermore, Seattle has two games in hand on Dominic Kinnear's side and served notice last weekend that, with MLS Cup to be staged in the Pacific Northwest this year, form on the road could lead to glory at home.

Well played, young men



While Seattle is a young franchise, Toronto FC is just young. Against DC United, Toronto started five rookies, and seven of its first 11 were aged 24 or younger. A 2-0 win was an ample reward for the faith shown in the youngsters and further evidence of the fine job done by Chris Cummins at BMO Field.

Having passed that test, TFC's youngsters now face even bigger challenges, with five of their next six games coming away from home. These are no run-of-the-mill road trips, either. The shortest journey is to Chicago, which is the last venue to be visited on a stretch of the schedule that also features voyages to Chivas, Seattle, Colorado and Los Angeles.

The coming six weeks or so represent the litmus test for the progress Toronto has made since John Carver left the club. If it can get through with its playoff hopes still intact, Cummins' prospects for having the ""interim"" removed from his job title will be exponentially boosted. However, if the youth movement fails to build on Saturday's promise, the result could be a vacant coach's seat as well as another postseason-less campaign.

A thing that made me go hmmm



So much for my ""How will Freddy Adu fit in with Odense?"" prognostications! A week after I optimistically wrote that a move to Denmark could benefit his career, the switch appears to have collapsed, leaving Adu back at a crossroads.

In my opinion, given this latest setback, the next two weeks represent the most important of Adu's professional career. If he cannot arrange a move from Benfica before the European transfer window closes, the young forward will almost certainly face a further four months without competitive soccer.

With Benfica's summer moves a clear indication that Adu has no immediate future at the Stadium of Light, the need for a change was obvious. Should it fail to transpire this month, the 19-year-old's stock will continue to drop, to the extent that he will no longer be seen on the radars of many European clubs.

Seeing red



Finally this week, an update on one of the most remarkable stats in MLS this year: After a weekend in which six red cards were shown in as many games, the total number of players sent off in MLS this season now stands at 54, which equates to one every 2.87 matches.

With more than two months remaining in the regular season, the current total trails that of the entire 2008 season (one every 3.56 matches) by just five. Fifty-four is level with 2007's final number (3.61) and has already exceeded the 44 red cards issued in 2006 (4.36).

The folks in the league's disciplinary office must be the hardest-working in MLS."
63,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4405071/count/61/a-night-forget-w-connection,A night to forget against W Connection,"I would like to start this week's blog by wishing Landon Donovan a full and speedy recovery. When a friend told me that Landon had contracted swine flu, I laughed at first. I laughed because I didn't believe him, and what I found more humorous was how random and out of the blue the comment was. Now that the illness has been confirmed, I wish Landon the best. It's unbelievable that he found the strength to play in a World Cup qualifier, in front of 100,000 people who hate him, with a virus of that magnitude running through his body.

Now, I am not what you would call a die-hard soccer fan. I love the game more than anything aside from my family, and it has been my life for 29 years now, but I am not glued to the TV every weekend watching every game I can. Having said that, when Charlie Davies opened the scoring Wednesday in Azteca Stadium to put the U.S. up 1-0, I literally jumped up and screamed the way my 2-year-old son does at the mere sight of Elmo. (How I hate that furry @#$%@*.) Maybe it was the great buildup that the ESPN commentators provided in their half-hour pregame show, talking about how the U.S. had never won at Azteca Stadium, or maybe I am becoming a soccerhead! I don't know what it was, but it was exciting.

Perhaps the way my season is going I needed to feel some excitement, any excitement associated with soccer. It has reached the point where I am taking out my frustrations on my 5-year-old son in my backyard. Every day we go out back to play one-on-one to work on his skills. Nine times out of 10, I let him score the winning goal and enjoy watching him run around with his hands over his head screaming as though he just won the World Cup. It's one of the many things I enjoy as a parent. Well, during the past couple of weeks, he hasn't won or even scored a single goal. I am using our little play time to boost my confidence. My wife put an end to it yesterday, though, after she watched through the kitchen window in horror as I timed a perfectly executed two-footed tackle on the wee man, then got up and tapped the winner into his open net. Daddy was put in timeout, while wee man had two scoops of vanilla with sprinkles.

I ended my last blog on the eve of Red Bull's first Champions League match down in Trinidad & Tobago. Allow me to recap. Bear with me as I make frequent sprints to the bathroom to vomit at the memories. As a player, the first two to five minutes of every match are vital mentally. That's the time it takes to realize what exactly you are in for and up against. Having never played W Connection before, we did not know what to expect. The coaching staff did its best to scout the team, but the real scout was to take place in those first five minutes of the game.

Five minutes in, we felt confident. We were knocking the ball around them and getting chances on goal. Their only threat was on the counterattack. Just before halftime, they lined up for a corner kick. The ball was served close post, where one of our players deflected it off the crossbar and one of their players tapped it in. Down 1-0 going into the half, we weren't panicked or down on ourselves because we'd dominated but couldn't put away our chances.

We started the second half the way we played the first, in their half, attacking. Three minutes into the second half, newly signed midfielder Ernst Obster put away a slightly deflected goal to tie it at one apiece. Twelve minutes later, Alfredo Pacheco was a bit fortunate as his shot was deflected twice and ultimately past the keeper to put us ahead 2-1. I felt great at that moment because of how disastrous our season has been. This tournament was a way to bring something positive back to the organization. However, 12 minutes later, they equalized after we failed to clear a low cross that was buried off the post and into the net. The final score was 2-2.

It wasn't what we had hoped, but it was a decent result considering the way the tournament rules are set up. Away goals are extremely important. All we had to do on the return leg was win, tie 0-0 or 1-1, and we would be through. Worst case was that we would tie 2-2 and have to play overtime.

What did we do, you ask? We totally fell apart. On the return leg the following week at Giants Stadium, we led 1-0 on a goal by John Wolyniec halfway through the first half, only to give up two goals within the final five minutes of the half. The second half consisted of our pressing for the tying goal, only to be turned away every time. We had many chances but couldn't capitalize.

I still remember after the game, one of the opposing players walking up to me and said the better team didn't win the series. I appreciated his words, but they didn't shed any light on what I considered the worst loss in my career. Walking out to meet my family after I showered, I was in a bit of a daze. As I picked up my two sons, Dylan, my 5-year-old, told me that he loved me and said, ""It's OK, Daddy."" At that point I kissed him, handed him to my wife and walked off by myself. Something that I wanted so badly was not taken away from me but rather given away. It was the worst night in my 12-year career."

When trying to decide what to write about for my first blog, the obvious choice was a review of Wednesday's U.S.-Mexico game and the U.S. team's 2-1 loss. However, a look back at the national team's continued struggles in Mexico City seemed unnecessary. By the time you read this the talking points will be exhausted (the lack of possession by the U.S., subpar officiating, the intimidation factor of Azteca) and fans will have moved ahead to thinking about the team's next World Cup qualifier against El Salvador on Sept. 5 (7 p.m. ET, ESPN Classic). Instead, I wish to take a look at how much excitement and attention continue to surround U.S. soccer after an incredible summer that has led many casual sports fans to jump on the bandwagon as the 2010 World Cup nears.

For decades we heard the prophecies that soccer was bound to conquer the U.S. Despite these confident claims made by lovers of the game, soccer's ascent into the mainstream of American sports has not come about -- something cynics often cite when arguing against soccer's place and future in this country. With that said, the amount of media attention the U.S. team has received during this non-World Cup year is extraordinary and has resulted in many more casual fans' developing a taste for the sport and a rooting interest in the national team. Friends of mine, who at one time showed little to no interest in U.S. soccer and the game as a whole, were suddenly texting me throughout the Confederations Cup and in the days leading up to the U.S.-Mexico game, expressing their opinion of the team. They are now among the many who have joined up as fans of the national team and, more importantly, as fans of the game. Count Colin Cowherd, host of ""ESPN Radio's The Herd with Colin Cowherd"" and co-host of ESPN2's new ""SportsNation"" show, among these new fans. Cowherd has apparently seen the light, become a fan of the beautiful game and actually refinished his basement in anticipation of all the U.S. soccer parties he's going to host.

The recent interest in soccer and the national team shown by new fans, like Cowherd, can be attributed to many factors, including the U.S. team's strong summer performances and the media attention it generated. But on a larger scale, the steady progressions the game has made in the United States over the last decade have been brought about by the rise of soccer-specific cable networks, Internet video, preseason summer tours put on by big European clubs and even the popularity of video games like EA's ""FIFA"" series. And while the use of technology and marketing has greatly helped the sport's popularity in the U.S., its continued rise must also be attributed to the game's global appeal.

""It's the pageantry, the fiesta, the spectacle of it all,"" Cowherd said when asked where this sudden love came from. So while disappointment is sure to abound after the U.S. team's most recent loss in Mexico, it's been a pretty positive summer for those of us who one day hope to see the same type of soccer hysteria here as is seen around the globe. If this all keeps up, Sam's Army should have plenty of new recruits by the summer of 2010.

Serie A Begins

The Serie A season begins next weekend, and while Italy's top league still must be regarded as one of the best in the world, it has not enjoyed the best offseason. The summer departures of top foreign players like Kaka and Zlatan Ibrahimovic further weakened a league that was already struggling to keep up with the star power of its Spanish and English counterparts.

However, Serie A's problems go beyond the loss of its top foreign players. The unwillingness of top clubs to consistently start young players has hurt the quality of play and left many fans frustrated. Last season, Mario Balotelli (Inter), Sebastian Giovinco (Juventus) and even Brazilian Alexandre Pato (Milan) were often kept out of their club's starting lineups. These omissions not only robbed fans of an opportunity to watch exciting young players, but they also led to media speculation that these starlets were prepared to leave their Italian clubs for more playing time on foreign soil, something the league can ill afford right now. As Serie A prepares for kickoff, let's hope some of its top teams come to their senses and give more playing time to soccer's future stars."
65,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4394225/count/61/is-freddy-adu-ready-step-up,Is Freddy Adu ready to step up?,"He may have hoped to have been in Mexico City today but, instead, it seems that Freddy Adu is poised to make the journey from Portugal to Denmark, where, reports suggest, he is to sign for Odense on a season-long loan.

Odense is a good side. Runner-up in the Danish Superliga last season, only once in the last seven campaigns has it finished outside the top 5. Should it beat Genoa in the Europa League playoffs, games in the competition's group stage would offer further playing opportunities for Adu. However, it should be noted that similar positive thoughts abounded when the young American joined Benfica and Monaco, and in neither setting did he excel.

Thus, while, on the face of it, the move (assuming he makes it) is a good one, the dominant issue when it comes to Adu remains not where he plays, but whether he plays. This is a player who last saw time in a club game Dec. 21 of last year. That was with Monaco, for whom he logged precisely 95 minutes in nine appearances off the bench throughout 2008-09.

Denmark has become a popular destination for Americans on the fringes of Bob Bradley's first-choice squad. For some, such as Benny Feilhaber, moving to the Scandinavian nation has been the catalyst for a return to the top table. Others, such as Michael Parkhurst and Jeremiah White, have had more fleeting looks in less critical situations with the national team.

Having just turned 20, Adu still has time on his side, which is just as well, for he has a long road ahead of him if he is to fulfill the potential he showed in glimpses during his teenage years. It is to be hoped that Odense offers him the chance to log some minutes and establish himself in a position, be it on the flank or supporting a main striker.

On his Twitter page, Adu continually tells us how hard he is working. Hopefully, with this latest move, he will be rewarded with some better luck.

A thing that made me go, ""Hmmm ""

Is there a more in-form team in MLS at the moment than Los Angeles, which finds itself second in the West after having won five of its last six games?

The most impressive aspect of the run has been the efficiency with which L.A. is putting away its opponents. Credit for this has to go to Bruce Arena, who is the clear leader at this stage, in my opinion, for the league's Coach of the Year award. Having been given time to build the team he wanted, Arena now oversees a group that plays exactly as he demands.

The return of David Beckham was handled masterfully by the wisecracking Brooklyn native, who addressed head-on the issues surrounding the Englishman. The result has been a successful assimilation for Beckham, who has become one of the team, as opposed to ""the man.""

Against New England on Saturday, there was less frantic chasing into corners from Beckham, who neither felt compelled to take the ball off his back line before launching over-ambitious 70-yard passes. Around him are players he trusts and who know how to do the jobs they have been given. It all bodes increasingly well for an L.A. story this postseason.

Well played, young men

Perhaps the only team that can argue it is playing better than the Galaxy is Columbus, which has won four in a row following a late show against San Jose.

The Columbus resurgence has similarities to that of Los Angeles, in that it has been masterminded by a coach -- Robert Warzycha -- who needed some time to put his stamp on the team. Furthermore, the Crew has also won methodically, with an ever-improving defense providing a solid foundation on which to build.

However, while the Galaxy has stars such as Beckham and Landon Donovan, Columbus has hit peak form without the league's most valuable player. Guillermo Barros Schelotto has not played since July 11, but his absence has not been felt, thanks to the form of Jason Garey and Steven Lenhart.

Behind the front two, Robbie Rogers and Eddie Gaven have found some of their 2008 form, while goal-scoring displays off the bench by Alejandro Moreno and Adam Moffat on Saturday were further boosts for the defending champion, which, after a slow start to the season, looks to have found even more ways to win."
66,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4388589/count/61/no-surprises-us-roster-mexico,Monday Morning Musings,"Well, there's no doubt that all attention this week will be on the U.S. game against Mexico at Estadio Azteca. I'm actually going to be off to Boston for a work-related conference, so I will be MIA for most of this week. For those of you unable to catch the game on TV on Wednesday, Jeff Carlisle will be doing a live play-by-play for you to follow.

Anyway, here's what I'm thinking about this Monday:

1. The U.S. roster for Mexico. No real surprises about the squad named by Bob Bradley. As I'd predicted in last Friday's podcast, it was always likely to be more or less the Confederations Cup squad, save for the addition of Stuart Holden. It's no real surprise that Sacha Kljestan and DaMarcus Beasley were dropped; neither have played well for club or country for some time now. Chad Marshall's inclusion is interesting for two reasons: First, it means that he probably has moved ahead of Danny Califf in the pecking order; secondly, it likely means Bradley will persevere for now with the Oguchi Onyewu-Jay DeMerit center-back pairing, with Carlos Bocanegra on the left.

The rest of the lineup pretty much picks itself, with only two spots up for reasonable debate. Does Bradley go with Steve Cherundolo or Jonathan Spector at right back? And does he persist with Charlie Davies and Jozy Altidore as the forwards or replace one with Brian Ching? To the first question, Cherundolo might be the better choice because he's more mobile than Spector and possibly better equipped to handle Mexico's Andres Guardado. In terms of forwards, there's no doubt in my mind that Bradley starts Ching and sends one of Davies or Altidore to the bench. My guess is he sticks with Altidore and uses Davies as a change-of-pace guy in the second half.

By the way, for those who want a 'prediction' of the game, check out this nifty simulation by the folks over at EA who put this together for us with their new FIFA 2010 game (due out later this year).

2. Soca Warriors bolster their lineup. This past weekend, Trinidad & Tobago's Newsday reported that English Premier League players Bobby Zamora (of Fulham) and Jlloyd Samuel (of Bolton) have finally received their T&T passports and will be eligible to play against the U.S. when the teams next meet, on Sept. 9. Considering that T&T now boasts an all-EPL strikeforce, with Zamora partnering Kenwyne Jones and Wigan's Jason Scotland coming off the bench, this game looks a lot harder for Bradley's men all of a sudden.

3. Landon Donovan is in the best form of his life. There's no doubt that his success in the Confederations Cup has elevated Donovan's confidence to an all-time high. It shows in the way he's playing -- and not just against MLS opposition. Since he has returned from South Africa, his play has continued to be exceptional -- the biggest noticeable difference being that he has become far more direct in his play. He has shown a marked increase in his willingness to run at opponents with the ball in his possession -- something we saw against Barcelona, AC Milan and Everton in the All-Star game. He also has shown more aggressiveness in shooting when the opportunity presents itself. Witness Saturday's goal against the Revs, which in my mind won't be surpassed this season in MLS: a first-time off-foot volley from outside the box that swerved into the top right far corner. Earlier this year, while Donovan was with Bayern, you could still see elements of tentativeness in his play, but I really think the Confederations Cup has removed that from his game.

4. Freddy Adu is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Things continue to go from bad to worse for the one-time prodigy, who now finds himself desperately seeking a new club this season. Even after leaving the Gold Cup early to return to Benfica, he failed to impress management there and was told that he doesn't feature in the team's plans this season. Despite practically pleading for a Dutch club to pick him up -- even going so far as to say in an interview that he ""grew up with the Dutch league"" (a peculiar statement given that a few years ago he claimed to be a lifelong Chelsea fan) -- so far interest from Dutch teams has been minimal. Even NAC, whose technical director is former U.S. star Earnie Stewart, has shown no interest. So what now for Adu? It's hard to say, but his career seems to have reached a critical crossroads. How he fares with his next club (the rumor mill has him headed to Danish club Odense) will be critical.

5. Liverpool can overcome the loss of Xabi Alonso. For starters, though Alonso's a fine player, I tend to think he had a career year last year. He's certainly not a player that over the course of his five-year Liverpool career, had played consistently at the level of a player that would justify the enormous fee Real Madrid paid for him. Bear in mind that Alonso become one of the most expensive players ever at Â£30 million, in fact when you consider that he's the eighth-most expensive player in history, then you can argue that Real overpaid for him.

Now, don't get me wrong: In many ways, Alonso was critical to the way Liverpool played. His range of passing is exceptional, and as the team's metronome he kept the ball moving. The simple reason Liverpool struggled when he didn't play is that it didn't have any players of Alonso's ilk to replace him. That has changed now that Liverpool has bought Alberto Aquilani. Although Aquilani actually more closely resembles Steven Gerrard as a player than he does Alonso, I'd argue that Liverpool could become far more explosive with a healthy Aquilani than it was with Alonso. Of course, with Aquilani -- a player whom some Italian observers have labeled ""made of Swarovski Crystal"" -- staying healthy is the big question mark.

There's also the Lucas X factor -- a statement that, on the basis of his first two seasons with Liverpool, I thought I'd never utter. Put in plain terms, Lucas has been mostly terrible and lacking confidence. Indeed, I've never seen a midfielder backpass so often, and he has tended to treat the ball like a hot potato. Having said that, he has appeared to be a completely different player this preseason, spraying passes forward, carrying the ball at times (against Atletico he weaved past three players on a mazy run) and generally looking revitalized. Could this be the season Lucas emerges as the player Liverpool thought it was getting from Gremio? We'll see, but between Aquilani and Lucas, I believe Alonso's shoes will be filled. The greater concern is, and continues to be, the overdependence on the health of Gerrard and Torres. I'm surprised Rafa Benitez has yet to address the need for a third quality attacking option and matchwinner to supplement them -- although if the latest reports are anything to go by, Benitez has been handicapped yet again by the financial shenanigans of Liverpool owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett."
67,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4379568/count/61/altidore-headed-hull-prove-himself,Altidore headed to Hull to prove himself,"After a summer of debate and discourse over where he would end up, Jozy Altidore finally has a new home: Hull. For next season at least, the 19-year-old American will ply his trade at the KC Stadium. It will not be easy.

As impressive as it was in the opening half of last season, Hull faded badly in the new year, only avoiding relegation on the final day of the campaign, and will start the new season as one of the favorites to go down. If the British media is to be believed, Everton and Fulham were also in the mix for Altidore and, in that company, the Tigers offered the least attractive option.

However, regardless of the overall fortunes of the team, by joining Hull, Altidore has earned an opportunity to log regular playing time (in a World Cup year) in one of the best leagues in the world. With a multimillion pound move for Bobby Zamora seemingly dead, aside from Daniel Cousin, there are few proven front men in the squad.

In some ways, this move is a win-win for Altidore. If he is successful and scores the goals to keep Hull up, a permanent move may be in the cards, unless Villarreal is so impressed that it recalls him to its first team. If things go well personally but Hull is relegated, his stock will nonetheless be high. Even if he struggles and Hull goes down, Altidore has a full season in England under his belt and, at 20, time still on his side.

Physically, Altidore has all the tools, and his strength and pace will worry many a defender. The area in which his biggest improvement must come is what he does with the ball at his feet. If he can adapt to the speed of play in the Premier League and demonstrate that he can operate as a target man, who can link play when needed (for Hull will play with one up front at times), he can be successful in England.

Of course, a sideshow for any player going to Hull is working for Phil Brown, a manager unlike any other Altidore has experienced in his short professional career. Bob Bradley, he ain't. The Tigers' manager appeared to unravel in the latter parts of last season which, among other incidents, featured a halftime team talk on the field against Manchester City, as well as a number of brushes with his players (just ask Geovanni) and the Football Association.

Despite his tender age, Altidore has consistently demonstrated a maturity level which suggests he is able to handle any situation and continue to get better as a player. His next test will be his biggest but also, quite possibly, his most rewarding.

A thing that made me go 'hmmm '

Curt Onalfo was fired this week after failing to turn Kansas City from a perennial playoff participant into a side that can challenge to win the MLS Cup. The end was bloody, with the axe falling soon after the Wizards were thumped 6-0 by FC Dallas.

Into the hot seat, at least until the end of the season, steps Peter Vermes. Highly regarded as a technical director, the New Jersey native now faces the task of turning around Kansas City's fortunes by getting more out of many of the players, the signings of whom he was the brains behind.

Four of Kansas City's next six games are on the road, and points must be garnered if the Wizards are not to be cast adrift toward the foot of the Eastern Conference. The roster has his mark all over it, so can Vermes get out of his players what Onalfo could not? His own future could depend on how he answers this question.

Well played, old man

Kudos to FC Dallas' Jeff Cunningham who, against the Wizards, became the ninth player in MLS history to score four goals in a game and, in doing so, offered Hoops fans an intriguing look at a promising partnership with David Ferreira. With Kenny Cooper Germany-bound, the combination should continue to blossom as Cunningham gets more time in his best position of central striker, as opposed to the wider role he often occupied earlier in the season.

He might turn 33 later this month but, after bouncing around the league for a while, Cunningham's 2009 form shows he still has much to offer, not least to a Dallas team which, with a couple of more wins and continued improvements at both ends of the field -- Saturday's win was just the second it has achieved with a shutout this year -- could yet make an unlikely push for the postseason.

Stats attack

Maybe it's the heat that has everyone hot under the collar but, in the past two weeks, eight red cards have been shown in 13 matches. Over the previous six weeks, only five players had been sent for an early bath.

Furthermore, my (rough) calculations show that, in MLS in 2009, a player has been sent off every 3.11 games. By way of comparison, in the EPL last season, a red card was issued once every 6.03 matches."
68,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4368991/count/61/seeing-sights-trinidad,Seeing the sights in Trinidad,"When we boarded the American Airlines jet that would be taking the Red Bulls down to Port of Spain Trinidad this past Tuesday, we all had a reason to be upbeat and optimistic. While we haven't given up on the ""movie plot"" scenario of us winning our last 10 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the season, steam rolling through the playoffs then raising MLS Cup, it's not likely. Besides, I've already had my movie-plot moment when I made out with Jodi Moltisante at my seventh grade fall dance against all odds and obstacles. Those obstacles included escaping the wrath of her older muscle-bound brother, and the odds that my song request of Bon Jovi's ""Never Say Goodbye"" would be enough to lure her in. The beating that her brother gave me on the following Monday was the small price I paid for the 15 or so seconds of bliss I experienced during Jovi's serenade.

Since the playoff dream is on the verge of impossibility, the CONCACAF Champions League means a new season with a clean slate: a way to represent the fans, the organization and our families in the way that they deserve to be represented, a area in which we have failed so far.

So, as I was being all up-beat and optimistic, I approached my aisle seat in the last row of the plane. I started to think about the inch and a half of leg room my 6-foot-2 frame was about to squeeze into ahead of the ""Redemption Game."" But, before I could think about it for too long, a familiar voice called my name out. As I turned and saw that it was coach, he handed me his first class ticket, at which point I practically knocked him over to get up there for fear that he would change his mind. I was joined in the front by Juan Pablo Angel, Albert Celades, Kevin Goldthwaite and Dane Richards. Angel, Celades and myself were like senior citizens sinking into a hot bath.

We made a quick stop in Miami to change planes, then off to Trinidad. Upon landing in Port of Spain, I was immediately reminded of the island mentality. Everything is so laid back and about 15 minutes behind schedule. So it was no surprise that it took over an hour to get through customs. It was funny but frustrating to realize why it took so long. When it was finally my turn, the customs agent started and carried on a five-minute conversation about the weather, economy, his family and the plant life on the island, which is nice, even though it was midnight. I'm just used to the 10-second New York routine where they scream ""Do you have any drugs?"" as they are throwing your clothes around.

We finally got to our hotel, ate and crawled into bed sometime around 2 a.m. We had breakfast at 9 a.m. and boarded our bus for training at 10 a.m. Now, I never realized how big of an island Trinidad is until we drove over two hours to get to practice. Apparently, the driver took us to the wrong field and then got lost, which didn't make sense to us. Were the nice people of Trinidad trying to make our trip a bit uncomfortable prior to the game?

The two-hour journey wasn't a total loss. It gave some of us time to play cards. ...

Have I ever mentioned in previous blogs what a terrible, unlucky gambler I am? I can play anything you challenge me to and feel confident that I will come out on top, but the minute that stakes of any kind are introduced, my luck changes dramatically. I guess that explains my wife's strict rule of one casino visit per year, at which time she confiscates every piece of plastic in my wallet, puts a hold on our bank accounts, hides my sons' piggy banks and frisks me at the casino door for any cash that I may have hidden on top of the budget amount. She has to do this because I LOVE TO GAMBLE! Please, do not misinterpret this. I hardly gamble at all. It's just that the few times a year that the opportunity is presented, I dive in like a kamikaze.

So when the cards were pulled out on the bus, a cold sweat began to make its presence felt on my forehead. I was relieved to hear that the guys did not want to play for money, but I became bored after a short time. Honestly, what fun are cards without at least a non-monetary wager involved, no matter how small? Looking out the window at the filthy rain water that was puddling up on the sides of the road, we decided that whoever lost the next game had to do a swan dive across the field at practice.

We finally arrived to the stadium for our practice. The field was in much better shape than we thought it would be. We started with a small possession game to get warmed up. The humidity was beginning to build up by the time we finished warming up. Our captain, Angel, gathered us in the middle of the field. The thing about JPA is that he doesn't speak often, but when he does, he has a way of drawing you in and making you believe in what he is saying. Speech over. Time for practice. As we began to play and go over some things, the sky turned on the shower. The rain pouring down was a great escape from the humidity. Going through our set plays at the end of practice, it was hard not to notice the huge dirty puddles building up around the field. So as the word was given from coach that practice was over, I turned, sprinted and dove head first into the most disgusting water I have ever seen. I told you I was an unlucky gambler.

I will report on the actual game in my next blog. That is, if I'm still alive after my splash in the cesspool."
69,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4363889/count/61/major-league-soccer-midseason-report,Major League Soccer midseason report,"The MLS break for the All-Star Game allows us to look back at the first half of the season as clubs prepare for the run-in, which looks set to feature some fierce battles for postseason places. As I write, 12 of the league's 15 clubs have at least 21 points, but only two -- Houston and Columbus -- have reached 30.

Here are my thoughts on what each team has done so far, as well as a pondering or two on how the second half of their season might play out:

EASTERN CONFERENCE



Columbus (30 points in 19 games)



Looking back: The defending champions did not register a win until their eighth game but since then have taken 25 points of a possible 36. Guillermo Barros Schelotto was the main man at the start of that run, but the Crew's last two wins have been achieved without the reigning MVP, or Robbie Rogers or Chad Marshall.

Looking ahead: The way Jason Garey and Steven Lenhart have seized the spotlight recently bodes well for Columbus to make a run at defending its title. While Barros Schelotto remains a key man, Robert Warzycha knows his squad has a depth that can handle its CONCACAF Champions League schedule and still be better than most in MLS.

Chicago (29 in 18)



Looking back: Inconsistency brought about by a lack of a settled starting XI blighted the Fire's early season, but its form has improved lately. Cuauhtemoc Blanco's aging legs have been carefully used by Denis Hamlett, while a back line that posted one shutout in the opening eight matches of the campaign conceded just once in four July games.

Looking ahead: Brian McBride's shoulder surgery is a devastating blow to Chicago. In the veteran's absence, Blanco has to elevate his game even further, and those around him -- specifically Marco Pappa and Chris Rolfe -- also need to step up. The wild cards might be the hitherto inconsistent Justin Mapp and Patrick Nyarko.

DC United (28 in 19)



Looking back: After solving their early-season inability to retain leads, DC has hit form, losing just twice in 16, although half of those games have ended in draws. Josh Wicks has done well in goal, while rookie potential -- led by Chris Pontius -- has blended well with the veteran contingent on the roster.

Looking ahead: Commitments could compromise DC's hopes of clinching a fifth MLS Cup. In addition to the U.S Open Cup final, Tom Soehn's side has to contend with the Champions League. Success in a two-legged preliminary tie would lead to six group-stage games, meaning United would play 19 times between now and Oct. 24.

Toronto (26 in 19)



Looking back: There's rarely been a dull moment north of the border so far this season, where Toronto has won as many as it has lost. A slow start did in John Carver, but Chris Cummins has steadied the ship, though apparently not yet sufficiently to have the ""interim"" tag removed from his title as head coach.

Looking ahead: Only three clubs have conceded more than the 30 goals TFC has allowed, and each of those has yet to reach 20 points. The impressive Stefan Frei needs more solidity in front of him. If defensive profligacy continues, as important as are Amado Guevara and Dwayne De Rosario farther forward, even more vital is a regular scorer.

New England (23 in 16)



Looking back: Given the games missed in the first half by key men, including Taylor Twellman and Shalrie Joseph, for New England to be where it is at the break is an achievement in itself. With at least two games in hand on each of the sides above them, the Revs are well-placed for a late-season run if they can keep their best players fit.

Looking ahead: With the back solidified and the outlook for Twellman uncertain, Steve Nicol's main focus will be finding goals from alternative sources. Joseph has chipped in, as has Steve Ralston, but the likes of Kheli Dube and Edgaras Jankauskas have to make regular contributions, too.

Kansas City (21 in 17)



Looking back: Three wins in four in April suggested that the Wizards were capable of making a push to the top in the East. However, since then, maximum points have been claimed just twice. The veteran trio of Josh Wolff, Claudio Lopez and Davy Arnaud have been consistent, but like many other coaches in MLS, Curt Onalfo remains a (predatory) striker short.

Looking ahead: Perhaps Zoltan Hercegfalvi is that man? Further boosts will come from the return of Arnaud and Jimmy Conrad following Gold Cup duty. Like New England, Kansas City have games in hand and its playoff hopes could be decided over the next six weeks, during which the Wizards play five of seven matches on the road.

New York (10 in 21)



Looking back: Must I? I am sure few Red Bulls fans would thank me for doing so. Two wins and 10 points from 21 matches (no other team in the league has played 20) tells the story of, to date, one of the worst seasons in the history of the league. Juan Carlos Osorio might still have a job simply because nobody on the planet could turn this campaign around.

Looking ahead: Thank goodness for 2011 and a new stadium. Other than that, perhaps a run in the Champions League could give long-suffering New York followers something to cheer. Their only ambition in league play for the rest of this season will be to spoil to their rivals' postseason hopes.

WESTERN CONFERENCE



Houston (32 points in 19 games)



Looking back: When Houston is good, it is really good, as a run of 10 wins in 13 games between mid-April and mid-July shows. Before and after that, however, Dominic Kinnear's men struggled. The squad is among the strongest in the league but international absences as well as injuries and suspensions slowed the pace in the weeks before the All-Star break.

Looking ahead: Can the Dynamo sustain a season that began in February? Last season's Champions League will give way to this year's successor and Kinnear will need to work his magic if Houston is to battle for silverware on two fronts. Keeping Ricardo Clark until the end of the season will help.

Seattle (29 in 18)



Looking back: Attention-grabbers from the start, the Sounders have made plenty of noise in their maiden MLS season. From back to front, Seattle is solid through the middle and has a number of bona fide winners. Fredy Montero is the star, but do not underestimate the roles played by unsung heroes, including Nate Jaqua, Osvaldo Alonso and Tyrone Marshall.

Looking ahead: Can they sustain their form? Despite the franchise's rookie status, the experience and ability of the roster (and coach Sigi Schmid) suggests the answer should be yes, although a road-heavy remaining schedule -- four of 12 matches are at Qwest Field -- will make the task a little more challenging.

Los Angeles (28 in 19)



Looking back: After a hideous end to the 2008 season, making his team hard to beat was clearly a priority for Bruce Arena. Thus, although there were a few too many draws, the Galaxy's start to the season was acceptable. Four wins and a draw in the last five have built on those foundations.

Looking ahead: Talent-wise, this is a strong team. Aside from the flair offered by the usual suspects, the shrewd acquisitions of Donovan Ricketts, Gregg Berhalter and Stefani Miglioranzi have given Los Angeles real solidity. The combination of style and substance could make for a potent playoff participant.

Chivas (27 in 17)



Looking back: As one Home Depot Center inhabitant has ascended, so the other has slipped from top in the West back into the chasing pack. Four straight defeats were a poor way to conclude a first half that began at such a pace. The conference's lowest scorers, Chivas has yet to score three times in a game. Fortunately, the back line remains strong.

Looking ahead: Preki has to solve the offensive issues if the Goats are to make a fourth straight postseason appearance. Sacha Kljestan (no goals and one assist in 12 games) needs to wake up, while Paulo Nagamura's status as the club's second-leading scorer is an indictment of Chivas' strikers, Eduardo Lillingston apart.

Colorado (27 in 18)



Looking back: One of the league's more consistent teams, in that there have been few sustained peaks or troughs, Colorado has ridden the offensive output of Conor Casey and Omar Cummings -- the pair has scored 14 of the team's 28 goals -- through the first half. Home form has been key recently.

Looking ahead: Casey and Cummings will continue to get their share of goals but the front two could do with some support. New arrivals Jamie Smith and Pat Noonan could provide that assistance, as could Mehdi Ballouchy. We'll know more about this Rapids side in a month, after they have played four home games in five.

Salt Lake (23 in 18)



Looking back: A little like those of Colorado, RSL's results have been up and down all year. Only once has the club won two straight games, a number that is matched by its longest losing streak. Rio Tinto has not been quite the fortress it was in 2008, but it is away from home, where only five points have been taken from nine games, that the real problems lay.

Looking ahead: If the spine of Nick Rimando, Jamison Olave and Kyle Beckerman stays fit and in form in support of the enigmatic trio of Javier Morales, Yura Movsisyan and Robbie Findley, Salt Lake could yet push for the playoffs. The final day fixture at home to the Rapids could be a huge game.

Dallas (17 in 18)



Looking back: To win games, you have to keep goals out, and one shutout in 18 games is a big reason the Hoops have struggled this season. Going forward, they have some talent but not enough to cover for a back line that, in spite of Schellas Hyndman's tinkerings, has shipped goals consistently.

Looking ahead: Hyndman has to find a way to get makeshift defender Pablo Richetti back into midfield. Without him alongside, Dax McCarty has struggled to stem the flow of traffic toward the Dallas goal. Recent points have been won from losing positions, which suggests FCD's fighting spirit is still there.

San Jose (14 in 18)



Looking back: ""San Jose could be the dark horse,"" I wrote at the start of the season, adding that the addition of Bobby Convey and Cam Weaver made the Earthquakes a contender to win the West. Oops. Weaver is gone and Convey would be if another club would take his salary. Meanwhile, Huckerby is a shadow of the player who needed just 14 games to win the 2008 Newcomer of the Year award.

Looking ahead: Ryan Johnson and Arturo Alvarez have been bright spots and offer a young base around which Frank Yallop can build for 2010, for this season is as good as over. Next year's squad list is likely to look vastly different from the current roster, which features too many underachievers."
70,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4357657/count/71/us-loses-psychological-edge-mexico,U.S. loses its psychological edge,"Granted, U.S. fans knew that coach Bob Bradley was fielding a B/C team in the Gold Cup tournament. It's probably also true that some might even have been ambivalent about whether the U.S. won or lost the final against a Mexico B team, but absolutely no one saw the nature of this loss coming. A 5-0 loss on home soil that can only be described as a total and utter humiliation. Here's what I'm thinking about that result.

1. Has the U.S. lost a valuable psychological edge? From the U.S. perspective the answer is a resounding no. Fans and players alike will shrug this off as a result of fielding an understrength lineup and they'd be right. U.S. confidence is still at an all-time high and the debacle produced by the U.S. reserve team in New Jersey has zero bearing on how the full lineup will perform at Azteca on Aug. 12. Of the 11 players on the field, only Brian Ching has a reasonable expectation that he'll be facing El Tri in the World Cup qualifier.

However, what has undoubtedly been broken is Mexico's mental block and inferiority complex about beating the U.S., particularly on American soil -- something El Tri had failed to due in their previous 11 tries dating back to 1999. You have to question the decision of coach Bob Bradley in not utilizing the additional seven-player roster addition that CONCACAF had granted the U.S., and recalling some of his better players such as Benny Feilhaber and Charlie Davies for the knockout stages.

By fielding such a weak lineup in the final, the U.S. effectively facilitated giving its hated rival a huge boost to its confidence, especially before a critical qualifier and also at a time when Mexico appeared to be at its lowest ebb in well over a decade. That lack of confidence has been shown by a series of poor performances in qualifying, a revolving door at coach and an extremely shaky start to the Gold Cup. To let Mexico win in such emphatic fashion can only improve its mind-set -- El Tri won't care that they beat a weak U.S. lineup; in their minds, they've exorcised their demons. It won't surprise me at all to see a far less panicky Mexico side take the field at Azteca and probably show a lot more calmness and composure in front of goal, too.

2. Perhaps the U.S. isn't as deep as some thought. The manner of the defeat certainly didn't help the international prospects for certain players, several of whom saw their stock fall immeasurably. Midfielder Kyle Beckerman undid virtually all of his positive work in the tournament so far with a largely anonymous performance. Similarly, while Chad Marshall had put together some solid outings (particularly against Honduras), his culpability as part of a back line that basically laid down and rolled over, can't be ignored. Midfielder Robbie Rogers also did nothing to dispel the notion that while he prospered in the early going against weak teams (Grenada in particular), his contributions were stifled against better opposition.

Yet again, left back Heath Pearce did nothing to change my opinion that he's totally overmatched at international level. A shaky first half for Pearce turned into a full-blown meltdown in the second half, when he was completely out of position the entire time -- practically extending Mexico an invitation to raid his zone with impunity. The only two players to make it out of this tournament with any real credit and serious consideration for the current first-choice squad are Stuart Holden, who definitely deserves to move ahead of at least Sacha Kljestan in the pecking order, and Troy Perkins, who looks like he could genuinely challenge Marcus Hahnemann for the No. 3 goalkeeper spot.

3. The penalty that was or wasn't. Much has been made of the controversial penalty awarded to Mexico when Jay Heaps brought down Gio dos Santos, with some observers arguing that it was dos Santos who actually fouled Heaps (with an elbow to his head). I'd argue that it was a very soft penalty call, but probably a penalty call nonetheless and here's why.

Heaps clearly had his hand on the back of dos Santos' jersey and pulled him back. OK, it wasn't a huge tug, but it was still a tug. As dos Santos was falling backward, he elbowed Heaps in the head, but Heaps was already falling backward himself anyway as a result of said tug and his own poor positioning.

Having said all that, I've rarely seen a team fall to pieces like the U.S. did once a penalty was given against them. A dubious penalty should hardly be enough cause to precipitate the type of collapse we saw, where it seemed that certain members of the U.S. team had simply given up. It's also worth bearing in mind that dos Santos was later denied a certain penalty when Rogers hacked him down in the box (again, Pearce wasn't even in the zip code at the time).

On the positive side, you could argue this result will galvanize the U.S. regulars further ahead of the Aug. 12 meeting. Indeed, postgame statements by both Ching and Holden saying it'll be different when the two teams meet again attest to that. However, with Mexico looking the most susceptible it's ever looked to losing at home to the U.S., this result has probably only made it that much harder for the U.S. to pull it off.

71,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4352991/count/71/us-backups-maintain-gold-standard,U.S. backups maintain Gold standard,"Another United States-Mexico final was far from an inevitability this time around, but the two Concacaf giants will meet at Giants Stadium in New York on Sunday to decide the Gold Cup. The cast of characters on both sides might be different from in recent clashes, but U.S. fans have every reason to feel confident about this group of players.

It wasn't always pretty for the U.S. in its 2-0 semifinal victory over Honduras. For much of the first half, the U.S. lacked ideas offensively, mainly because of some weak distribution from the two central midfielders. But once players like Robbie Rogers and Stuart Holden began receiving the ball in dangerous positions, the opportunities started coming, one after another.

Rogers even took matters into his own hands on one occasion, intercepting an errant pass and going around a Honduras defender with a brilliant first touch, before firing a rocket that forced the goalkeeper to make a great save. That was my favorite of flurry of chances late in the half that culminated with Clarence Goodson's opening goal.

The U.S. continued to control the match early in the second half. Davy Arnaud, who struggled in the first 45 minutes but picked things up after the break, provided a genius pass to Rogers, who was taken down in the box and should have earned a penalty.

Arnaud's inclusion in the starting lineup the past two games, at the expense of Santino Quaranta or Kenny Cooper, is the one questionable move coach Bob Bradley has made in the tournament, but the Kansas City Wizards standout did enough to maintain his place alongside Brian Ching, who was absolutely fantastic on Thursday.

Jay Heaps has certainly justified his selection at right back, nearly scoring a goal against Honduras from a corner kick. Then again, just about every American player had a good scoring opportunity off a set piece on Thursday night. This U.S. team has become lethal in that department.

Heaps also played his part in a competent defensive performance by the Americans. In addition to scoring a goal, Goodson formed a solid parternship in the middle with Chad Marshall, containing a potentially dangerous Honduras side. They were helped by Logan Pause and Kyle Beckerman, who were both extremely active.

The good news for U.S defenders is that when they do falter, goalkeeper Troy Perkins has proven he can make the big saves, as he did late in the game by denying Carlos Costly from inside the area. Perkins came up big in the only other Honduras chance the entire match, tipping a Marvin Chavez shot onto the crossbar in the first half.

However, the American team is not perfect by any stretch. It lacks creativity in the middle of the park, as Holden, the only player with any kind of playmaking skills, spends the majority of the time on the right wing. And Ching has never been the type of striker to create much on his own. But the U.S. is solid enough in every other part of the field, and has proven itself resourceful when it comes to scoring goals. The emergence of Cooper the past two games and the exclusion of Quaranta from the first team gives the squad some semblance of depth.

The makeshift group will likely need to put forth its best performance of the tournament on Sunday, but it is facing a Mexico team that typically brings out the best in American players.

Not to mention his Robin-esque sidekick with whom a bromance-type spat has developed in LA-LA land over, dare I say it, criticism of said ""sexy man.""

Now don't get me wrong: Anyone who has ever met me for even five seconds knows that I am all for being outspoken, but when you criticize the man who is holding the future of American soccer between his beautifully manicured fingers, then you've gone too far, Buster.

I am surprised Mr. Donovan wasn't apprehended at Newark Airport upon landing and transferred to the MLS offices for a good old-fashioned flogging, or at the very least a meeting with the disciplinary committee -- which from past experiences I can tell you is the equivalent to listening to a Rod Stewart/Meatloaf mix tape on loop for a week straight.

Anyway, as for the game: Arriving at Giants Stadium was like arriving to Happy Hour during free wings night. Massive people were running around in circles waiting to get their ""sexy man fix."" So after passing through security, I headed to the locker room. Seriously, there was tighter security at the game than at President Obama's speech earlier that day, which happened to be in New Jersey. Apparently Obama had to wait to get to his own speech going because they shut down the Turnpike until ""sexy man"" got to the stadium safely.

Walking out to warm up was pretty much what I expected. When we, the HOME team, came out we were welcomed with the equivalent of a golf clap. The anticipation of ""sexy's"" arrival was at a riotous climax. As I was warming up I spotted my mom in the front row. As I approached her to say hi, she shot me a look and said, ""If you even think about kicking him tonight I will spank you right there on the field. Now get the hell away from me before I miss his entrance.""

The warm-up ends as the 60th teenager faints; we rush back into the locker room for a moment, and then back to the field for the start of the game.

Now, how can I describe the game? Los Angeles had three shots in the first half and scored three goals. Now I know in my last blog I stated that I will not be talking about the season anymore until we win a game, but I have to say one thing. When the soccer side ceases to work, it becomes a matter of will and heart and most importantly pride. Until EVERY player understands that, we will not win a game. The crowd couldn't care less that we lost. They were there for one thing. Whether it was to boo him or drool over him it was all about David Beckham."
73,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4336180/count/71/blend-beckham,Blend in like Beckham,"David Beckham certainly picked the perfect opponent to ease his way back into Major League Soccer on Thursday night. The Red Bulls have specialized in making opposing players look sharp this year. And joining a red-hot Los Angeles team also helped.

Bruce Arena's side was already emerging as a dangerous team for the second half of the season, thanks in large part to the acquisition of Alecko Eskandarian. His early masterpiece in Thursday's 3-1 win for L.A. must be a candidate for goal of the season so far, and Landon Donovan's strike later in the first half wasn't too shabby, either. Poor Eddie Lewis might not even crack the highlights with his goal.

Even Beckham's biggest detractors must concede he does make good teams better, so if the Galaxy can maintain this kind of form, perhaps the next few months won't be so bad after all. Against New York, Beckham showed glimpses of his quality, such as a gorgeous crossfield pass to Lewis early in the game and a nifty back heel to spring Eskandarian. His work rate was excellent, as usual.

But Beckham's exploits on the field can't erase how poorly he continues to handle this whole situation off the field. On his little media tour earlier this week, Beckham supposedly reaffirmed his commitment to the league, even as he spoke about the likelihood of seeking another loan to Europe in order to maintain his place on the England squad.

Although national team boss Fabio Capello seems happy to play the role of the villain in this story, Beckham was fully aware of the MLS calendar when he agreed to come here, and he needs to get his priorities straight. He will be 35 years old next summer, has already taken part in three World Cups, and all indications are that he will be nothing more than a bit-part player in South Africa.

Contrast his attitude with that of another former Premier League star: Freddie Ljungberg's impressive first-half performance for the Sounders, which earned him an all-star nod earlier this week, hasn't gone unnoticed overseas. His agent, Claes Elefalk, revealed to ESPN he has been contacted by several big clubs in Europe about his client's interest in moving back across the pond.

However, Ljungberg turned them all away, claiming he enjoys playing in the United States and wants to finish what he started. Then again, the former Arsenal midfielder has been able to play on a very good team in MLS, a luxury Beckham has never enjoyed, until now.

Searching for Gold

After an unusual, and unnecessary, layoff, the United States will finally return to action in the Gold Cup on Saturday against a dangerous Panama side that gave Mexico all it could handle in the group stage. And since the backups to the backups struggled against Haiti, Bob Bradley shouldn't have too difficult a time choosing a lineup for this game.

The only question mark is at right back, as Bradley must decide whether to give Brad Evans another start, or try a different option. Up front, I expect to see Davy Arnaud and Brian Ching, leaving Kenny Cooper on the bench. And Jimmy Conrad, who looked strong against Haiti, should partner Chad Marshall in the center of defense.

But the trump card of this team is the midfield. With the excellent Stuart Holden likely occupying a more central role alongside Kyle Beckerman, and Robbie Rogers and Santino Quaranta flying down the wings, the U.S. should be capable of creating plenty of chances and brushing aside Panama to set up a semifinal date against Canada or Honduras.

If, as expected, the U.S. reaches the final, Mexico will likely be waiting, setting up one of the more fun matchups between the two countries in recent years. Both sides will be fielding a host of new faces, bringing a different flavor to the rivalry.

We're minutes away from the kickoff. Beckham has been given the nod to start in central midfield tonight, which is an interesting choice by coach Bruce Arena. Mostly because Beckham rarely shines in that spot and is infinitely better when he's stationed out on the right.

Beckham and Donovan slap hands and give each other a manly hug before at the halfway line, probably just to reinforce one more time that things have indeed been patched up.

1 min: We're off. And straight away Beckham draws a needless foul by Kandji. The ball is played out wide to Lewis, who finds Eskandarian. Eskandarian carries the ball to the top of the penalty area and in acres of space with time to shoot, simply falls down. I'll give him a pass and attribute that to the slippery artificial turf.

3 mins: GOAL. Los Angeles 1-0 New York. A stunning start for the Galaxy as fans have barely had time to settle into the game. A high bouncing ball falls to Eskandarian, who flips it up over Sassano's head, turns and slams a wicked 25-yard shot into the top left-hand corner of the Red Bulls net. Stunning goal.

5 mins: First attack from the Red Bulls. Hall with a run down the right, before checking back and lofting a cross into the Galaxy box which Ricketts gathers with ease.

7 mins: Angel, who has made a habit of scoring against the Galaxy in this fixture, makes a silky run down the right and into the box, beating two Galaxy defenders and hammering a shot from an acute angle that looks headed inside Ricketts' near post, but the Galaxy keeper beats it out.

9 mins: Berhalter gets a yellow for a clumsy challenge on Kandji at midfield. A bit harsh though, since he got to the ball first and Kandji's subsequent somersault over the top was hardly his fault. From the free kick, the ball is lofted into the Galaxy box for Angel, who outleaps two Galaxy defenders and heads it goalbound but it sails just over. Angel looks very motivated tonight.

11 mins: Beckham finally gets on the ball with time, to a smattering of boos, and switches play with a beautiful 40-yard ball out to the left flank which falls perfectly at Lewis' feet. The cross from Lewis is straight at Cepero.

13 mins: The Red Bulls are looking lively at present. A nice move up the left started by Pacheco, who sends a ball into the Galaxy box to Angel's feet. He lays it off to Zimmerman out on the right, who chips the ball back in looking for Kandji, but Galaxy rookie Gonzalez nods it away.

16 mins: Both teams are bypassing central midfield right now with aimless long balls up and down the field. Not the most aesthetically pleasing stuff. The ball is finally played out wide to Red Bulls rookie Jeremy Hall, who has time and space, but sends his cross into orbit with a hefty slice that John Daly would be proud of.

19 mins: Amazing. We actually just had two short passes along the ground played in succession between Stammler and Celades. The second pass earns the Red Bulls a free kick as Kandji is fouled by Berhalter as he waited for the ball. The free kick is about 35 yards out dead center. To the surprise of many, Rojas takes the free kick and it takes a deflection off the wall wide. That made perfect sense, let the guy with all of two career goals in two years in MLS take the free kick, as opposed to one of the most prolific scorers in the league, who actually scored from a similar spot against the Galaxy a couple of years ago.

22 mins: A long booming clearance by Ricketts down the right finds Donovan breaking free. Pacheco jumped to head clear but whiffed badly, leaving Donovan open in tons of space. He drives to the edge of the box and pulls back a wicked cross which beats Cepero, but Petke makes a great interception and clears.

24 mins: The Red Bulls are playing a man down with Rojas having injured his ankle just now in a challenge with DeLaGarza. Rojas is on the sideline getting some treatment. I'd like to say that the Red Bulls will miss Rojas, but to be honest, given the way he's generally played since landing in MLS, I'll go out on a limb and say he wouldn't be missed.

27 mins: Rojas is back on and both teams are at even strength again. Beckham has a free kick just inside the halfway line out on the right. He's still getting a smattering of boos, but they sound a bit half-hearted, but the boos get louder when he opts not to send in a cross and instead slide a short pass down the right to Donovan.

29 mins: Both teams seem to have forgotten there is something called a midfield. Another long ball over the top finds Eskandarian about 50 yards offside but amazingly the linesman keeps his flag down. Eskandarian lays it off to Donovan, who cuts into the box and crosses it but it's cleared out for a corner.

30 mins: GOAL. Los Angeles 2-0 New York. The crowd have decided to boo Beckham full-on now and they give him an earful as he goes across to take the corner. It's an inswinger but cleared by the Red Bulls. Miglioranzi takes a swipe at it but miscues it to his right where it falls to Donovan. Donovan's about 25 yards out, takes a look and hammers a half-volley into Cepero's top left corner. Another stunning goal and the Red Bulls must be thinking it's not their night.

32 mins: Galaxy free kick dead center, about 30 yards out. The anticipation rises as Beckham lines up his shot. It's not one of his better efforts though and fails to clear the wall.

35 mins: The Red Bulls look devoid of ideas here and can barely retain control of the ball. A couple of passes through midfield, before Stammler sweeps the ball out to Rojas out on the left. Rojas, with time and space, lets the ball run over his foot and out of bounds. Enough said about that really.

36 mins: Beckham gathers the ball in central midfield and slides it to Eskandarian. Eskandarian takes a couple of steps and tries his luck, hitting a vicious long-range effort which dips, but sails over the crossbar.

37 mins: Finally, a bit of life from the Red Bulls. The rookie Hall picks the ball up wide and embarks on a winding run past two Galaxy defenders into the box, before slipping a delightful through ball past Gonzalez that so nearly finds Kandji wide open in the 6-yard box.

39 mins: The camera pans to a shot of some Red Bulls fans who look very, very confused. I can only assume they're trying to figure out if they should boo Beckham or boo their own team.

41 mins: Stammler picks up the ball about 35 yards out and unleashes a fierce left-foot shot that Rickett does well to parry. The ricochet falls to Rojas just outside the 6-yard box and surely he can't miss, but believe it or not, Rojas does. He blasts it straight at Ricketts when a simple tap to either side of the Galaxy goalie would have done the trick. Angel looks exceedingly frustrated and no wonder, he was right there too but Rojas waved him off.

44 mins: GOAL. Los Angeles 3-0 New York. Another long punt upfield by Ricketts finds Donovan, as Pacheco continues to play matador defense. How is it that Pacheco looks so good when he plays for El Salvador but so bad when he plays for the Red Bulls? Donovan curls in a deep cross to the far end of the box where Lewis meets it with a first-time volley. Cracking goal.

HALFTIME: Los Angeles 3-0 New York. Well, just when Red Bulls fans thought it couldn't get any worse, it just did. Juan Carlos Osorio's side just gave up three goals in a single half to a team that was barely averaging more than a goal a game entering tonight's matchup. It's been a fairly drab match, but one that's been punctuated by three stunning strikes, all of which resulted in a Galaxy goal.

The crowd is pretty sparse for a Beckham affair, possibly around 25,000 or so, which is weak in comparison to past matchups against the Red Bulls (the 2007 matchup drew 66,000 or so). It's yet another indication that the Beckham 'magic' is surely on the downturn for MLS.

45 mins: The second half is under way. The only question is whether or not the Galaxy go for the jugular and try to score more goals, or whether they're content to sit on their three-goal lead and go into snooze mode. Given that Arena was fired by the Red Bulls organization, I'd say Arena would unleash the hounds of hell this half if he could.

47 mins: Two Beckham set pieces in quick succession amount to nothing. First a free kick out on the left, and then a follow-up corner. His set-piece delivery this evening hasn't been the sharpest.

49 mins: Celades sends Rojas clear on the edge of the Galaxy box with a delicate chip, and the Venezuelan responds with a powerful shot that is parried wide for a corner by Ricketts.

52 mins: An uneventful couple of minutes as the Galaxy start to knock it around like a training session. Donovan took off on another spirited run past Pacheco, who has been beaten like a drum tonight, but his attempted give-and-go with Buddle failed, when Buddle decided to try to whip it across to Eskandarian instead.

54 mins: Beckham misplaces a pass by chipping it straight into Zimmerman's chest from about 5 yards away. Meanwhile, the crowd appears to have given up trying to boo him, although for that last effort, they probably should have.

58 mins: It's rather surprising to me that Osorio has yet to make a sub. How much more evidence does he need to see that his present configuration has yet to jell on the field. One could say the Red Bulls flat-out suck, but I believe in constructive criticism.

60 mins: Apparently the Red Bulls are trying to sign a star-name center back like Marco Materazzi to shore up the defense. I'm not sure just how much benefit that'll be. Call me a cynic, but I'd argue that nothing short of a bearded old man carrying a dusty tome, holy walking stick and the ability to part the Red Sea could help this squad right now.

62 mins: Sometime in the last few minutes, speedy Dane Richards came on for Celades. His pace should give the Red Bulls a decent option down the right.

67 mins: If you're wondering about the infrequency of updates the last few minutes, it's because there has been absolutely nothing worth writing about. But in short summary, it's been pass, misplaced pass, interception, tackle, pass, turnover, misplaced pass.

68 mins: Something finally happens! Buddle rips a shot from just outside the box, which tests Cepero and draws a good save from the Red Bulls goalkeeper.

69 mins: And that'll be the end of Beckham's night. He's subbed off for T&T international Chris Birchall. Beckham goes off to the sound of boos and some smattering of projectiles aimed in his general direction. Beckham's had a very quiet night and hasn't really impressed.

72 mins: A couple of half chances for both teams back-to-back. First Ricketts does his best David James impersonation with a mad rush of blood to the head and races out of his box to try and clear a ball. He miskicks and only DeLaGarza's intervention prevents Richards from latching onto the loose ball with Ricketts stranded. Then, heading straight down to the other end, Birchall tees up Eskandarian to try his luck again with another shot that Cepero gets down to block.

74 mins: A couple of strategic subs, Eskandarian comes off for Mike Magee, while Zimmerman comes off for Sinisa Ubiparipovic.

78 mins: The last roll of the dice for Osorio who brings on John Wolyniec for Kandji. Pointless since this game was over at halftime, although the Red Bulls certainly haven't helped themselves with a second half that's been oddly lethargic considering they trail by three goals.

82 mins: Rojas with a long winding run which looks promising at first as he beats two Galaxy defenders, but right after finishing the hard work, he messes things up with a stray pass straight to Lewis. He had Richards open in space, but let himself down with the final pass.

84 mins: Chris Klein on for Eddie Lewis.

85 mins: Penalty for the Red Bulls. Ricketts misjudges a corner and it goes over his head to Angel, who's wide open at the far post and volleys it goalbound but it's blocked by Gonzalez, albeit with his arm. The ref has no hesitation in awarding the penalty even though Wolyniec bundled the rebound over the line.

86 mins: GOAL. Los Angeles 3-1 New York. Angel grabs a consolation goal for the Red Bulls with a calmly taken penalty which sends Ricketts the wrong way.

89 mins: Red Bulls have a free kick out on the left. Rojas sends it deep into the box and it's cleared, but then hammered back into the box where a Red Bulls player flicks it on and it's handballed by Gonzalez again. Penalty given!

90 mins: Angel's penalty is saved by Ricketts. The Red Bulls striker opted for the opposite corner to his last penalty and this time Ricketts guesses correctly and dives low to his left to save. Decent save but it wasn't a well-struck penalty from Angel.

FULLTIME: Los Angeles 3-1 New York. So nearly a fast and furious ending, but Angel's miss meant that the last couple of minutes of injury time tapered out. In any case, a Red Bulls comeback would have been totally undeserving given what had transpired in regulation time. For Los Angeles, the score was more spectacular than the performance, but the Galaxy were never in trouble and ran out comfortable winners.

Pregame banter

Some things in life are inextricably drawn to each other -- for example, a moth to a candle, or Eddy Curry to a box of Krispy Kremes. Thus, the U.S. media (scratch that -- world media) is inevitably obsessed about anything involving the English heartthrob export with iconic hairstyles, who has a habit of falling in and out of love with his latest affair of the heart, before callously moving onto new pastures at a whim. So while everyone else gets the more interesting assignment of focusing on Robert Pattinson dumping Kristen Stewart, I, on the other hand, am forced to make do with the definitely-not-stingy David Beckham.

Beckham's MLS season debut takes place tonight in the shape of a game on the road against the New York Red Bulls, and I've been tasked with bringing you the play-by-play of the game when it starts at 8 p.m. ET.

MLS fans will no doubt remember when these two teams met back in August 2007. The resulting 5-4 epic was one of the most entertaining shootouts in league history. Unfortunately for fans of exhilarating offensive soccer and wayward-comedy defending, tonight's clash is unlikely to feature the same kind of offensive pyrotechnics.

For a start, the Galaxy have become a far tidier defensive unit under coach Bruce Arena (coincidentally the Red Bulls' coach that night), while the Red Bulls have become simply pitiful. Back in 2007, the Red Bulls featured the explosive talents of both Juan Pablo Angel and Jozy Altidore, with sharp service out wide from Dave van den Bergh.

In contrast, the Red Bulls' roster now contains the likes of a frustrated Angel, USL refugee Macoumba Kandji (whose main claim to fame is a vague physical resemblance to Chelsea's Didier Drogba) and the aimless-dashes-up-a-blind-alley skills of ultimate one-trick pony, Khano Smith.

Not only that, but it seems that Red Bulls coach Juan Carlos Osorio has failed to bottle the excitement of last year's in-no-way-fluke run to the MLS Cup final. Even more sadly, Osorio has ditched his innovative 9-0-1 formation (responsible for said fluky run) used in those playoffs in favor of more conventional formations which have resulted in this year's abomination -- a shocking 2 wins in 19 games and a negative-15 goal differential.

As for the Galaxy, they too have undergone radical changes since that fateful night. For a start, with Beckham off on his jaunt in Italy, the team's defense has improved with the addition of young studs like Omar Gonzalez and the veteran leadership of players like Gregg Berhalter. More importantly, the team has really come together and bonded into a tight, professional unit that keeps things in-house and drama-free.

However, all eyes will be focused on the broken-but-supposedly-mended bromance that is Beckham and Landon Donovan. Tonight, we'll see if the two really have resolved their rift. Will they pass the ball to each other? Will they overcompensate with exaggerated celebrations and declarations of love if either scores? And will a positive result enable cynical observers to forget the rather disturbing fact that since Beckham joined the Galaxy on July 1, 2007, the team's record is actually 7-14-9 (W-L-T) with him and 13-11-13 without him?

I'll be back at 7:45 p.m. ET with the play-by-play."
75,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4323920/count/71/david-beckham-landon-donovan-spat-unlikely-linger,David Beckham-Landon Donovan spat unlikely to linger,"So far so good in the CONCACAF Gold Cup for the U.S., as Bob Bradley's men have qualified for a quarterfinal spot at a canter, without too much trouble (except fielding at times) and with a team that amounts to little more than an MLS all-star lineup. It's hard to gauge how well a player has performed, considering the paucity of competition against the likes of Grenada, Haiti and a second-string Honduras team. However, the reality is that if a player in question failed to stand out, that's a pretty strong indictment of his prospects at the international level. Here's what I'm thinking about this Monday:

1. The evidence at hand. So far, outside of Benny Feilhaber and Charlie Davies (who've shown they're a cut above the rest of the squad at the Gold Cup), only two players have impressed me. The first is Robbie Rogers, who looks vastly improved over his outing against Sweden earlier this year. Of course, until we see him against more challenging opposition, it's hard to tell for sure, but his direct play and willingness to run at defenders is refreshing. While his delivery still needs a fair bit of work, he's shown improvement in that area. Stuart Holden is the other who has impressed me. He continues to improve by leaps and bounds, and has stood out the past two games. I like the way he carries himself on the field, his willingness to demand the ball from his teammates and the long-range shooting ability he brings to the table, something the U.S. sorely needs.

As for those who haven't impressed, Freddy Adu's performance already has been much discussed, but put Kenny Cooper and Michael Parkhurst in the category of those who also failed to step up. In Cooper's case, he already was working at a disadvantage, since I don't think Bradley rates him all that highly to begin with. However, Cooper's no-show against Haiti (he wasn't helped by the lack of service) probably dealt a huge blow to his hopes of making the 2010 World Cup squad. It won't surprise me if that's the last we see of him in the Gold Cup. As for Parkhurst, his performance has been surprisingly shaky. He has been caught badly out of position several times and has been muscled off the ball too easily for a center back, which also was a problem during the 2008 Olympics.

2. The drama that is the L.A. Galaxy. So unless one has been living in a vacuum somewhere, it's a safe assumption that everyone is aware of the spat between Landon Donovan and David Beckham, whom Donovan essentially accused of being a bad teammate and not being committed to MLS.

Looking at the controversy, I think the whole thing has been blown badly out of proportion by the general media (things become a lot clearer when you read the book and look at things in their proper context). About the only real controversy is that Donovan spoke about his feelings to a reporter before speaking about them to Beckham in private -- something Donovan, to his credit, has since publicly admitted was wrong.

The only other question in my mind was whether the rest of his Galaxy teammates shared Donovan's viewpoint. That was basically the point of the Steve Davis piece we ran last week.

(Now, note that contrary to a couple of bizarre e-mails I received on the matter, at no point in time has it been implied or suggested that Grant Wahl's book misrepresented the situation. Nor has there been a question as to the accuracy or the integrity of his reporting. Wahl is a great writer, and as you'd expect, his book is extremely engaging. For Galaxy fans in particular, it's obviously essential reading.)

It's clear (based on other excerpts in the book and also on sources who spoke anonymously to us) that most players on the Galaxy didn't view Beckham in nearly as harsh a light. In fact, most saw him as a good person and teammate but a bad captain, and most didn't think his commitment to the team was an issue. In regard to how they viewed his captaincy, it's somewhat in line with how most of England regarded Beckham's tenure as the national team captain (he's always been considered more of a figurehead than an actual leader).

In terms of commitment, there also is no question that initially, and for most of his first two seasons, Beckham was fully committed to the cause. He played on a severely injured ankle and he played a day after playing in Europe for England. And for those who watched the games, it was obvious he was tracking back on defense and giving it his usual effort. It probably all started to fall apart the day the Galaxy fired best friend and confidante Terry Byrne as team consultant. I'd argue it was Byrne's dismissal and not that of Ruud Gullit that drew Beckham's ire. Add that dismissal to the team's spiraling results and England national team coach Fabio Cappello's suggesting that Beckham needed to play in a higher-level league to retain his place on the England team, and it's easy to see why (if not forgive how) Beckham's interest tailed off.

Going forward, the only thing Galaxy fans need to be concerned about is whether Beckham and Donovan can co-exist. My feeling is they can and they will. Regardless of whether or not they can restore their friendship off the field, on the field, there won't be any issues. It's also likely to be trouble for the rest of the league, as the Galaxy now is far more solid defensively than at any other point during Beckham's tenure. Add the fact that throughout his career, Beckham has made a habit of playing extremely well in response to harsh criticism. A motivated Beckham, combined with Donovan, will make the Galaxy a dangerous proposition if the team can reach the playoffs and, dare I say it, a serious dark horse for the MLS Cup."
76,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4319670/count/71/honduras-performance-positive-us-soccer,Honduras performance positive for U.S.,"Honduras is not as poor as Grenada, so as expected, the U.S. encountered a few more difficulties in the 2-0 victory Wednesday night. But overall I thought it was another exceedingly positive performance from this makeshift group.

Against an opponent that actually applied pressure on the ball, the play was a bit ragged at times. But with Kyle Beckerman taking charge in the midfield, and Robbie Rogers always providing an outlet down the left side, the U.S. was able to get up the field and look threatening throughout the game.

The U.S. back line was split open once or twice on the counter but remained fairly composed. Chad Marshall in particular was outstanding. Right back Steve Cherundolo also put in a good shift, though he didn't have as many opportunities as Heath Pearce for overlapping runs, given Santino Quaranta's penchant for drifting toward the middle.

Once Bob Bradley removed Logan Pause and Freddy Adu -- the two worst players on the night -- the rest fell into place, as substitute Charlie Davies was able to stretch the Honduran defense even further and Benny Feilhaber added that last bit of creativity in the midfield. The final 20 minutes was a massacre.

For his part, Adu appeared over-eager to impress, continually running down blind alleys. In what turned out to be his final match of this tournament, thanks to a (supposedly) pre-arranged agreement with Benfica, he simply tried to do too much. It's tough to say how much these two games hurt his standing with Bradley, but they certainly didn't help.

Nevertheless, the U.S. has showcased its depth in this competition so far, and with a place in the next round virtually assured, Bradley can continue to test out different combinations Saturday against Haiti and expect similar results.

Running with the Devils

Anyone completely bowled over by the news of AC Milan's signing Oguchi Onyewu hasn't been paying close attention to the plight of one of Europe's biggest clubs. The Italian giants are in dire financial straits, even after selling Kaka to Real Madrid, and have become bargain hunters in the transfer market, seeking out loan deals and free transfers.

Onyewu's out-of-contract status made their eyes light up, as did his play in the Confederations Cup. As I mentioned in this space last week, Onyewu was the U.S. player earning the most rave reviews from the Spanish and Italian papers, so the move wasn't all that surprising.

He definitely represents an upgrade over some of the players Milan was trotting out at the position last season, like Philippe Senderos and Giuseppe Favalli. There are certain aspects of Serie A he might struggle with, but overall, I think he will do fine.

And the fact that Alessandro Nesta arrived for preseason training this week healthy and raring to go is actually a good thing. If Nesta's back holds up, it will mean less playing time for Onyewu, as Thiago Silva is expected to pair with Nesta, but a better Milan will create a much more positive atmosphere for Onyewu to settle in.

Unwelcome guest

Since this will be my final chance to blog before David Beckham makes his much-anticipated MLS season debut against the New York Red Bulls on July 16, I just wanted to reiterate my position that forcing Beckham back here to play the rest of the 2009 campaign makes no sense.

If recent comments by certain L.A. Galaxy teammates are any indication, the hostility from the fans is nothing compared to the frosty reception he will receive in the locker room. Beckham's return will bring plenty of attention, but for all the wrong reasons.

Given my luck with predictions lately, Beckham will probably play the best soccer of his career, rediscover his love for America and decide to see out the remainder of his deal with MLS. But more likely, I believe, we are headed for a very awkward few months.

77,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4316705/count/71/beckerman-rogers-gold-standard,Beckerman and Rogers the Gold standard,"Two wins with six goals scored and none conceded represents an impressive statistical breakdown of the U.S. team's Gold Cup campaign to date. Bob Bradley's side has been efficient in its dispatching of inferior opposition and should have few problems wrapping up first place in Group B against Haiti on Saturday. Should they do so, the U.S. will secure itself an evening quarterfinal in Philadelphia, as opposed to an afternoon last-eight match in Dallas.

Among those to impress through two games is Kyle Beckerman. The Real Salt Lake midfielder has been the outstanding player in the middle of the park versus both Grenada and, especially, Honduras, against whom he linked defense and attack on a number of occasions. Unfortunately for Beckerman's chances of forcing his way into the squad for upcoming qualifiers, he plays in a position for which Bradley has myriad options.

Also doing well is Robbie Rogers, whose ability to run with the ball at the right time, as well as the adeptness he has shown for linking up with those around him, shows a good deal of progress from the stuttering start he made to his senior international career against Sweden in January.

Beyond this pair, also showing promise has been center back Chad Marshall, while midfielder Stuart Holden impressed against Grenada. Up front, Charlie Davies enhances his growing reputation every time he steps on the field. Not so good so far have been the fullbacks, Steve Cherundolo and Heath Pearce, both of whom have shown that they are still working their way back to full match fitness following a period of inactivity.

Two tales of one city

What a contrast in fortunes there was for two local heroes on Wednesday night. While Santino Quaranta celebrated his first international goal on his home ground, Freddy Adu was left to rue another missed opportunity to prove why he should be involved more consistently on Bradley's teams.

Adu said on his Twitter after the Honduras game that he had felt heavy-legged. Four days later, he again looked to be trying a bit too hard to impress. The upshot was that his decision-making was suspect, meaning that he was caught in possession too often as he attempted to take players on, while passes to teammates offered better options.

Not that his troubles were entirely self-inflicted. Given that, prior to the Grenada game, the only minutes he had logged (for club or country) in 2009 were as a substitute in Costa Rica, match fitness had to have been an issue. However, his lack of sharpness was offset by a desire to catch the eye, for fear of not being seen again for a while, which was understandable. The result was plenty of good intention, but poor execution.

All of which makes the announcement that he will play no further in the remainder of the Gold Cup a puzzling one. On the one hand, he should do everything he can to take advantage of a chance to establish himself at Benfica. However, from the U.S. team's point of view, playing through a whole tournament would give him a chance to put together a run of games and to showcase himself to potential employers, in case his current club decides there is no future for him at the Stadium of Light.

Adu's long-term promise remains, but the more immediate implications for his enigmatic international career are that, with opportunities to impress ahead of the World Cup beginning to run out, it seems increasingly likely that, even if he does make Bradley's squad for South Africa, his chances to see the field will be limited.

Good luck, young man

Oguchi Onyewu has never been afraid of a challenge, and the American will certainly face one when he arrives in Italy to play for AC Milan. In addition to dealing with the rigors of Serie A, the defender joins a club in transition, following the departure of three key men: coach Carlo Ancelotti as well as talismanic players Kaka, who was sold to Real Madrid, and the recently retired Paolo Maldini.

The day before Onyewu's signing was announced by the Rossoneri, approximately 300 Milan fans staged a protest at the lack of transfer activity at the club. Whether they are pacified by this signing remains to be seen, but that is not Onyewu's concern. He must focus on making Leonardo's starting lineup, an achievement which would reap benefits not just for him but also for the national team.

Onyewu is the first of the U.S. team's Confederations Cup squad to reap a tangible (and financial) benefit of the impressive display in South Africa, and he may not be the last. Clint Dempsey has been linked with a move away from Fulham to Everton, while Jozy Altidore could be on the move too, though probably just on loan.

Perhaps the next to get his move, however, is Charlie Davies, on the verge of a move to French club Sochaux. I spoke to the striker earlier this week ahead of the U.S. game in his native New England on Saturday. Look out for that interview in the coming days.

A thing that made me go hmmm

Meanwhile, in MLS, Monday sees the announcement of the starting XI for this month's all-star game. As I wrote last week, while I am not a fan of the match in its current format, the showpiece remains an important one for those involved. Making picks always gets the old gray matter going and this year was no exception. Here is my selected XI:

GK: Kasey Keller

D: Bobby Boswell, Jhon Hurtado, Chad Marshall

M: Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Brad Davis, Stuart Holden, Chris Pontius, Shalrie Joseph

F: Kenny Cooper, Landon Donovan

While several of these names were straightforward, there were some over which more agonizing was done. Most difficult was the choice of who played up front. In the end, I went with Cooper and Donovan based on the importance they have for their teams, who often struggle without their talisman.

Fredy Montero made a great case with his recent form. But Nate Jaqua's displays, as well as the two-month slump during which he failed to score a goal, meant that the Colombian missed out on my ballot. Montero will be in Salt Lake City, however, and it would not stun me if he is named a starter.

Elsewhere, I felt it was important that this year's impressive rookie class was represented and, given that, picked Chris Pontius in midfield. Of course, as D.C. United is scheduled to play a CONCACAF Champions League preliminary match the night before the all-stars face Everton, he may not play even if he is selected.

Would that make an all-star game not an all-star game? That's another story..."
78,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4310568/count/71/seeing-red-elmo,Seeing red with Elmo,"Let me start off by stating that I will no longer be commenting on the Red Bulls games until we win. There are only so many times that I can say ""we lost again but have great players and are unlucky,"" and that time passed awhile ago.

However, one comment that I will make about our most recent misadventure in Dallas is that I have a new reason in life to be as good spiritually as possible. You see, when I woke up on game day in my nice air-conditioned hotel room and decided to take a stroll around Frisco, Texas, at noon, the 106-degree firewall I was greeted with put me as close to hell as I ever want to be. Couple that with the 95-degree temperature at game time, and that was enough to make me a choir boy for the rest of my days.

Mike Petke is burning in another way as well. I mean burning. Jim Rome has nothing on me right now. Stand us side by side and he would need a scarf, some mittens and a wool hat with a pompom on top. It all started three weeks ago in Toronto and came to a head today when I almost strangled Elmo. Yeah, that Elmo. The cute Red la-la-la-la one (more on Elmo in a bit).

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been asked by many people why I received a three-game suspension for my altercation in Toronto. So here is the complete and true story. (Disclaimer: I am a notorious hotheaded passionate person, but in no way endorse making any comments to referees.)

After the loss in Toronto, I walked past the ref on my way into the locker room. I figured that since we were going to be held accountable for our performance by our coach, then he should be held accountable for his. I said to him in a calm voice, ""That s--- wasn't good enough tonight."" (Disclaimer: You should never make any comments to a referee.)

Obviously, I hurt his feelings because he then produced a yellow card, which was my second, and then the accompanying red. I couldn't believe it. I didn't go up to him and scream obscenities at him; I made a statement that I felt was true. But the fact of the matter is that you can't look at a referee nowadays without the possibility of a card.

So, after seeing the red card, I saw red and spent the next seven seconds telling him what I thought of his decision. After my teammates grabbed me and told me that I had made my point, I walked to the locker room. I wasn't ready to go in yet because I wanted to cool down first. That's when the referee walked by and I had a second brief go at him.

Listen, I am not condoning my actions in the least bit. I have been in this league for 12 years and know from past experiences not to yell at a ref, but when I was informed of a three-game suspension, I was floored. That is the same punishment, and in many situations far more, than players have received who have thrown elbows and broken bones with reckless tackles. I guess verbally abusing a referee is viewed harsher than physically abusing a player. The coup de grace was my appeal process, which goes directly back to the same office that issued the suspension. Oh, it's a different person who hears the appeal, but does anyone reading this think the appeal ruling will go against a colleague?

So there you have it; three games and almost $1,500 in fines for yelling at a referee. That's the equivalent of an MLB player getting 16 games for getting tossed out of a game for arguing with an ump. When Roberto Alomar spit in the face of an umpire a few years ago, he got a six-game suspension. Mike Richter of the New York Rangers slammed a referee into the boards during a playoff game against the Devils in '94 and wasn't even penalized on the ice. Now, in no way am I condoning those actions. All I am saying is that I got suspended for 10 percent of my season for screaming at a referee!!! Think about that.

Now, on to my altercation with Elmo. First of all, let's get something straight. I love Elmo. I love him as much as any 33-year-old, somewhat sane man possibly can. If he were my neighbor, I would probably BBQ with him and his furry family. And after I put my kids to bed and he put his kids wherever the heck an overly happy hairy monster's kids sleep, I'm sure we would be knocking some drinks back and getting into all sorts of shenanigans. I guarantee that after a day of singing the la-la-la-la Elmo's World song, he probably gets blinded on Whiskey and whip-its. Now having said that, over the weekend my wife decided that we should take the kids to Sesame Place, which is an amusement park in Langhorne, Pa. I said, why not -- I'm off, it's going to be a beautiful day, and as I've already explained, I love Elmo!

So we set off in the morning bright and early. Now let me explain something to you. I am not what you would call a tolerant driver. I honestly believe that 90 percent of drivers got their license online. What I realized today, but more importantly what set me on the path to almost strangling Elmo, is that the closer you get to an amusement park the worse the driving gets. I'm talking 10 mph under the speed limit, refusals to turn on red, and don't even get me started on people's inability to merge. So as I'm honking and passing people, they are all smiling and giving the old thumbs-up with their Elmo and Big Bird shirts on, singing ""Sunny Day, Sweeping the Clouds Away.""

We finally get there, pay our $15 to park, get in line, look at the admission prices, and I tell the family ""OK, that was a fun day! Let's get going and beat the traffic."" After my wife calmed me down, we paid just over $150 to get into Sesame Place. That's when I had my first encounter with Elmo. After I paid, I turned around and was face-to-face with the red man. I said, ""Great prices, Elmo. Do I get a back rub with that?"" His response was to sing to me. I knew our paths would cross again. This took place a half hour later.

My 5-year-old son kept asking to go on this one water slide, but the line was way too long. I tried to delay until the line thinned out, but he wouldn't wait. Of course, I gave in. We get to the gate to check the height requirement, which was 46 inches. No problem, he is 48 inches, but I checked anyway and he just cleared it. We stood in line for 30 minutes and were just about to go down when a 16-year-old worker steps up and pulls out a stick to check my son's height.

Well, the stick shot above his head by 2 inches and he said, ""Sorry, he can't go on."" I told him, ""I don't know how big that stick is, but he is over 46 inches and cleared the stick downstairs"" -- but he wouldn't hear it. Now I started to see red as my son began to cry. As I turned around and walked back down the stairs, I locked eyes with Elmo as we hit the bottom step. He was just standing there smiling, waving and singing 6 inches in front of my face. That's when a voice in my head said, ""put your hands in your pocket."" And it was that voice that saved Elmo's life."
79,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4304408/count/71/west-best-east-sleeps,West is best while the East sleeps,"Given the unbalanced schedules of so many MLS clubs, there appears to be no definitive halfway stage in the regular season. Having said that, only New England (12) has played fewer than 14 games, while New York (18) is the only club to exceed 16.

Thus, with the majority of clubs having played at least 50 percent of their schedule, it's high time I gave my thoughts as to who I think are the leading candidates to lift the MLS Cup in Seattle in November, based on the evidence at hand.

The championship game's host has certainly shown that it has a squad capable of making a run deep into the postseason. From back to front, Seattle has balance and solidity, as does Chivas which, despite coming back to the pack in recent times, remains a well-organized threat.

However, Houston remains my pick as the best team in the West. Dominic Kinnear's side has championship experience in abundance, but the key to the Dynamo's resurgence after a slow start has been the way some of its youngsters have stepped up. In galvanizing their club, Geoff Cameron, Stuart Holden and Kei Kamara have established themselves as All-Star candidates.

While I am confident in picking Houston as the MLS Cup participant from the West, selecting the best side in the other conference is a more troubling process. D.C. United is just about worth its lead at the top of the standings but I remain concerned that their veteran players might struggle with the rigors of a full season.

United's ascent has been assisted by the enigmatic form of defending champion Columbus, which has become overly reliant on its talisman, Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Similarly, Chicago has flattered to deceive at times too, in part due to Denis Hamlett's continued struggle to find an effective attacking balance. After claiming seven points from its opening three games, the Fire has since taken 12 from 11.

What my eyes have seen tells me that two of the aforementioned half-dozen teams will battle it out at Qwest Field in the MLS Cup final. As we all know, the key to the MLS playoffs is to be there. After that, anything can happen.

Of the rest, Los Angeles is an interesting team, especially if Landon Donovan and David Beckham can put aside their personal differences when they reunite. Toronto has a ton of talent but I wonder if Chris Cummins' side has what it takes to eke out the road performances it will need to make a postseason impact. I look at Real Salt Lake in the same way.

Kansas City and Colorado are each a player or two short of challenging as they are currently constituted, but a couple of smart moves could thrust them back into the hunt. Meanwhile, New England is still in the picture despite a shocking run of bad luck with injuries, and you wouldn't bet against Steve Nicol to orchestrate another playoff run.

San Jose and Dallas do not have the depth to sustain a run up the standings in the West, while New York, which has the fewest points from the most games, should already be starting to look ahead to 2010. For everyone else -- though it might seem that MLS has been in the back of the minds of most in recent weeks -- the 2009 season is very much alive.

The gap closes in the Open Cup

For all but four clubs, MLS Cup is the only remaining piece of domestic silverware on offer, following a week in which several of the big boys had their noses bloodied, both literally and figuratively in some cases, by representatives of the USL, four of which have made it through to the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Cup.

Impressive showings from lower-league clubs in the competition are nothing new -- three made the last eight in 2008 after five had done so a year earlier -- and instead continue to show that, outside their first-choice XI, most MLS clubs do not have the depth to just ""show up"" and win with an under-strength side.

Adding further to the woes of MLS sides this year has been the reduction from 28 to 24 in roster sizes. Squad rotation has been made even more difficult by this, meaning that coaches have been forced to take risks just to get a team on the field.

An extreme example of this was seen Tuesday when, having started the game against Harrisburg with four subs, New England lost two more players to knocks after making their allotted changes, which themselves were necessitated by a need to give starters some sort of rest. A late red card meant they ended the match, farcically, with eight men.

It's been said before but I'll say it again. Rosters are not deep enough to sustain participating in multiple competitions at the same time, especially as many clubs also lose players to international duty. The travel involved adds further to the strain. It all means that, as we enter MLS' self-titled ""Summer of Soccer,"" the story for several clubs will be what is happening off the field as opposed to on it.

A thing that made me go ""hmmm ""

As I consider my picks for the All-Star game, I am reminded of the numerous flaws the match has in its current format. For example, beating B-list European teams -- no matter how great their history may be, not since Chelsea in 2006 has a legitimate powerhouse provided the opposition -- in preseason does little to boost the identity of the league.

If the MLS team wins, it's because its opponent was undercooked. If it loses, the league is viewed as weak. It's not as farcical as baseball's All-Star contest, from which the victor gains home-field advantage in the World Series, but it does seem to be taken a little too seriously (though only by one side). Let's have a USA versus Rest of the World contest featuring MLS-based players only and be done with it.

Two more factors irritate me. First, when selecting my starters, I have to pick a 3-5-2 formation. Soccer is a flexible sport in which alignments are fluid and ever-changing. Give me some options! Why is Landon Donovan classed as a forward only? Can he not also play in midfield? So let me pick him there if I want to!

Second, due to their participation in CONCACAF Champions league preliminary matches, players from D.C. United and New York will not be able to play in Salt Lake City if they are selected. Granted, in the case of the latter, there are likely to be no conflicts given the Red Bulls' wretched form but, where United are concerned, legitimate candidates such as Chris Pontius and Santino Quaranta, to name but two, will be involved in name alone.

Anyway, we have what we have and, overall, despite my objections about some of its aspects, the All-Star game has its merits. Chief among those is the chance it offers players to pad their rÃ©sumÃ©. Many have bonus clauses built into their contracts which are triggered by selection, which means making the squad is often more important than actually playing in the game itself.

Well played, young man

One man who will, barring injury, be in All-Star colors July 29 is Fredy Montero, who, after following a fine start to the season with a slump during which he failed to score between March 28 and May 23, has since rebounded spectacularly with five goals and five assists in his past seven games.

Montero was the early star of 2009 but suffered an alarming loss of form as rumors of off-field issues appeared to take their toll on the 21-year-old forward. Those now appear to be behind him, and Seattle has reaped the rewards as the Colombian has continued to develop a potent partnership up front with Nate Jaqua, who may himself be rewarded for his impressive form -- he has six goals and five assists -- with an All-Star berth.

In each of their three defeats, Sigi Schmid's men have failed to find the net. If their star strikers are able to sustain their form, the Sounders have a chance to challenge at the top of the Western Conference throughout the summer and into the fall."
80,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4299642/count/81/us-players-poised-payoff,U.S. players poised for payoff,"Before we get into the main topic of this blog, I just wanted to address one quick thing. My Confederations Cup piece has been interpreted as a big endorsement of Brazil's chances in the 2010 World Cup.

To be clear, I still don't love Dunga, and I remain convinced that the average Big Soccer poster has a better grasp of tactics. I was merely pointing out, begrudgingly, that given recent results, Brazil will probably be looked on as the favorite now. But as long as Gilberto Silva's dead body is prominently involved in the lineup, I'm not buying in just yet.

Of course, the big story by far was the performance of the U.S. team, and it will be interesting to gauge the immediate impact in the transfer market. Whatever biases Americans encountered overseas seem to have eroded. I have never seen the European press so complimentary toward U.S. players.

The general consensus appears to be that Oguchi Onyewu, Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley and Landon Donovan are good enough to play anywhere. With apologies to Jay DeMerit and Charlie Davies, who also boosted their stock this month, let's focus on those five and what the future might hold:

Oguchi Onyewu: No player helped himself more, particularly with his performance in the semifinal, which certainly caught the attention of the Spanish media. As a free agent, Onyewu will have his pick of the litter, but a word of caution: He is still a player with limitations and must choose his next destination wisely.

La Liga isn't the right place, despite his considerable prestige in that part of the world right now. While he had a nightmarish time at Newcastle, the Premier League could work with the right club, but my first choice would be Serie A, a league in which defenders aren't asked to venture too far outside the box to chase quick, diminutive strikers.

Jozy Altidore: A tricky one. Villarreal is actually a good club for Altidore, as long as he sees the field. The sale of striker Nihat Kahveci to Besiktas is great news, but the departure of manager Manuel Pellegrini is not. Altidore should find out as quickly as possible from new boss Ernesto Valverde whether he is in the plans for next season.

If Altidore is forced to move, his agent should revisit the Everton option. The Toffees expressed definite interest during the last transfer window before being having to settle for Jo. Altidore has the right size and enough technical ability to excel in the Premier League. Plays such as his tossing Spain's Joan Capdevila like a rag doll would drive English fans wild. Fulham are rumored to be interested.

Clint Dempsey: A silly omission from my all-tournament team. I wish I had a mulligan on that one. Dempsey has the best overall skill set of any American player. Fulham's improbable seventh-place finish in the Premier League last season, good enough for a Europa spot, means he will likely stay put, which is fine.

But if Dempsey were inclined to leave, for whatever reason, he would be advised to stay in England. Dempsey is one of the few U.S. players with the technical ability to flourish as an attacking player in La Liga, so Spain would be interesting, but there is no reason to leave a league he is comfortable in the season before the World Cup, and he recently said as much.

Michael Bradley: The criticism this kid receives from some fans is beyond me. Bradley is a terrific player and would be the linchpin of the U.S. midfield even if his last name were Jablonowski. Fortunately, he is viewed far more kindly across the pond, which is why a club such as Everton has apparently taken an interest.

Bradley could definitely succeed in England, but like Dempsey, a move away from a league he has really taken to might be an unnecessary risk at this point in his career. He should explore potential opportunities with better teams in Germany.

Landon Donovan: The most fascinating case. His recent stint with Bayern Munich was (unfairly) perceived as a failure, which means Donovan has two strikes against him in Europe. After playing some of the best soccer of his career over the past two weeks, will he give it another shot somewhere other than the Bundesliga?

The Premier League might not be a great option, either. Donovan is at his best when running at people on the counter. He is a player in desperate need of space. I would love to see him try his luck with a mid-table club in La Liga. After all, he should use those Spanish-speaking skills for something other than winding up Mexicans.

Podcast

A reminder to let you all know that because of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, there won't be a U.S. Soccer Show podcast this Friday. We'll be back July 10."
81,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4295417/count/81/reviewing-us-performance-south-africa,Reviewing the U.S. performance,"I'd said before the Confederations Cup final -- in which the U.S. lost to Brazil 3-2 -- that win or lose, it was important for the U.S. to play in a fashion that would prove to the world that its win over Spain was no fluke. And the team did just that. Whatever plaudits are sent the way of Bob Bradley's men after this tournament are more than well deserved.

That said, this tournament's display only becomes a watershed moment if the U.S. progresses out of the group stage at next year's World Cup -- and also makes the progression to a team that can consistently make it out of the group stage. Before U.S. fans start reading too much into the performance in South Africa, it's also worth bearing in mind that this isn't the first time a CONCACAF team has excelled in the Confederations Cup. In the 2005 edition, Mexico actually won its group, beat Brazil and was eliminated only on penalties in the semifinals by Argentina.

As with all things in life, one can always take away both positives and negatives:

The Good

1. The U.S. team's offensive flow. One of the most important things to emerge from this tournament from the U.S. perspective was the team's newfound ability to score from open play. For the past few years, the U.S. has generally had problems scoring goals that don't originate from set pieces. For a period, it even seemed that the U.S. team's predominant goal-scoring threats were either a penalty from Landon Donovan or a set piece goal from defenders such as Oguchi Onyewu and Carlos Bocanegra. The goals against Egypt, Spain and Brazil all came from the run of play and can only serve to increase the team's confidence that it can play with style and score quality goals at times. For a team that is built to defend deep and counterattack, an improved ability to score first is pivotal, especially because this is not yet a team that looks like it can put together the approach play to come from behind against a quality opponent.

2. The U.S. has finally settled on an effective formation. After varying dalliances between different formations and whether or not to use one or two strikers, the 4-4-2 that Bradley settled on from the Egypt game onward is the way forward for the U.S. The raw, but talented duo of Charlie Davies and Jozy Altidore have the physical traits to scare virtually any defense, and both show improving finishing ability and goal-scoring instincts. Their combined presence also prevents teams from pressing too high against the U.S. Spain's Fernando Torres remarked that he felt that the U.S. team became a totally different outfit from the moment it paired Davies up top with Altidore.

3. Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey prove their class. Both players have taken some heat in the past, Donovan for shunning Europe, Dempsey for not performing at the international level like he does for his club team Fulham. Both players answered the critics emphatically this tournament. In the case of Donovan, he was focused all tournament long and proved that he's the creative hub of the U.S. team. His work rate was exceptional and he showed up big in every U.S. game. Even if he doesn't make the move to Europe, for now, there can be no questioning his ability to play against the world's best players.

As for Dempsey, after a couple of laconic performances in the first two games, his effort was rightly questioned. However, here's the thing with Dempsey: On this U.S. team, he's what one would classify as the de facto flair player. He might not track back on defense all the time, and he'll frustrate you by giving the ball away needlessly, but for the U.S. that's not his job. His job is to provide those moments which can change the game, and against Egypt, Spain and Brazil, he delivered in a huge way with goals in each of those games. You could easily make the argument that out of all the players on the current roster, he's the most likely to create a goal for the U.S. out of nothing. It's certainly no fluke, either. Having scored goals against the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea at the club level, it's clear Dempsey has a knack for producing against ""big"" teams.

Even more notable than their performances was the raw emotion that both Donovan and Dempsey showed after the loss to Brazil. If there were ever any doubts that existed about either the heart or desire of either player, those doubts should cease now.

4. A new-look U.S. back line. I'd been calling for at least two years for Jay DeMerit to be paired with either Onyewu or Bocanegra in the heart of the U.S. defense and we've finally seen what that looks like. For me, the rationale has always been that Onyewu and Bocanegra are too similar, with virtually the same qualities. Thus, one should be paired with a more mobile center back, who reads the game better and is better equipped to handle pacy strikers who run at defenders, and that person should be DeMerit. There's no doubt that after the duo's sterling performances it'll be hard for Bradley to break up the combination.

On the right side, Jonathan Spector displayed very good positional sense and the ability to deliver exceptional crosses from the right. His lack of speed makes him a little vulnerable at times to wingers, but his other qualities more than offset that. At left back, I'm not entirely convinced that Bocanegra is the answer. However, as the acknowledged leader of the U.S. team, he has to be in the lineup, and defensively, while he like Spector is vulnerable to pace, he's unquestionably an upgrade over the likes of Jonathan Bornstein, DaMarcus Beasley and Heath Pearce at that spot.

The Bad

1. Tactics, subs and coaching adjustments. Considering the U.S. ended Spain's 35-game unbeaten streak and almost beat Brazil, it's a little strange that Bradley's coaching can be questioned. His ability to motivate the team and rally his players is certainly beyond reproach as the amazing turnaround from the U.S.'s first game to its final game showed -- and Bradley deserves full credit for that.

However, despite those performances, nagging doubts remain about Bradley's thought process when it comes to substitutions, lineup choices and tactical adjustments. Take for instance his substitutions: They seem almost always to be in reaction to something that happens (and often when it's too late) as opposed to a proactive decision on his part.

For example, against Brazil, not only did Bradley wait until the Brazilians had nullified the two-goal deficit before making his first move, but then he compounded the issue by putting the out-of-form Sacha Kljestan on the field for Benny Feilhaber, who'd played well up to that point. Given that Kljestan offers little to no defensive capabilities, Bradley would have been best served putting on Jose Torres instead. Granted, Torres' defensive capabilities are also questionable, but he offers far more composure on the ball and accuracy of passing -- something that was clearly missing in the second half for the U.S. It's a factor that Donovan himself mentioned as being the cause for the ineffectiveness of the U.S. counterattack in the second half.

In terms of the Bornstein substitution, he actually should have been brought on far earlier and soon after Luis Fabiano scored Brazil's first goal. After the first 10 minutes of the second half, it was apparent that Brazil was running rampant and given the U.S. team's inability to counter or possess the ball, the best solution would have been to park the bus. To do so effectively, what should have happened is that Bornstein should have been subbed in for a striker and Bocanegra should have been pinched inside as a third central defender, with Bornstein occupying a deep left back position to stop Maicon's runs. However, the U.S. never adjusted its tactics and you saw what happened.

2. Top teams generally don't blow two-goal halftime leads. Credit Brazil for its furious comeback, but the fact the Selecao were able to rampage over the U.S. the way they did in the second half is disturbing and evidence that the U.S. still has much work to do before it can consistently compete with the best. Not only did Brazil come back, it scored four goals in a single half (if you include Kaka's header which was unbelievably disallowed) -- almost unheard of at top-level football.

If you don't believe me, consider this stat: Since 2000, Brazil had won only two of 14 games in which it had trailed entering the half. It'd lost 10 of those 14. Sunday's win was only the third time in nine years Brazil had managed a comeback victory from a halftime deficit.

Part of the problem was the U.S. seemed to have no definitive plan for the second half. Usually when a team has a two-goal lead, you can either continue to attack and go for the jugular, or you can try to maintain ball possession and kill the clock (admittedly something the U.S. midfield isn't well-equipped to do) or you can park the bus and implement a smothering, disciplined defensive effort (see Chelsea vs. Barcelona at the Nou Camp). The U.S. was unable to implement an effective strategy, and until it can, holding leads will continue to be a problem against the best sides -- the U.S. can't simply count on almost inhuman performances from its central defenders and Tim Howard all the time to pull off upsets.

3. Questionable lineup choices. For the latter portion of the tournament, the U.S. seemed to hit on the perfect starting lineup. However, one could easily argue that it's very likely that were it not for a spate of injuries, we'd never have even seen this lineup.

It's no coincidence that most of the revelations for the U.S. only got their chance in the first place due to injury. Altidore and Davies, because Brian Ching was injured. DeMerit replaced an injured Bocanegra and has been behind even Danny Califf in the pecking order at center back, and of course Spector is starting because of injuries to Frankie Hejduk and Steve Cherundolo.

Consider also Bradley's loyalty to Beasley, Kljestan and Bornstein, all of whom have huge question marks over their current form and suitability for international soccer, yet all of whom have strong personal ties to Bradley (Beasley played for him at Chicago, Kljestan and Bornstein at Chivas). Of course, that in itself isn't a problem -- all coaches have personal favorites -- but it does become a problem when those players are continually picked to play over players who have shown equal if not far more promise on the playing field, such as the young midfield duo of Freddy Adu and Jose Torres, who didn't see a single minute in South Africa. No one's saying that Adu or Torres are ready to start, but surely they're better options at this point than either Beasley or Kljestan.

Podcast

Just to let you all know that due to the Fourth of July holiday weekend, there won't be a U.S. Soccer Show podcast this Friday. We'll be back on July 10."
82,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4285947/count/81/day-us-soccer-came-age,United States versus Spain: The day U.S. soccer came of age,"""All the f---ing experts in America, everybody who thinks they know about soccer, they can all look at the score tonight, and let's see what they have to say now. Nobody has any respect for what we do, for what goes on on the inside, so let them all talk now.""

Michael Bradley's words after the U.S. team's win against Egypt on Sunday. While his passion was welcome, my first thought was that I hoped he and his teammates would see the win as a beginning, as opposed to some sort of conclusion. After all, as impressive as the Pharaohs were, they are ranked 26 spots below the U.S.

Back it up against Spain, I started to write in a blog piece that was set to run prior to Wednesday's game in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Turn in a performance to be proud of, I implored. That's how those ""on the inside"" would get respect, I wrote. And although I hoped for the best, at no point did I contemplate that the U.S. would beat Spain. I don't think many did.

The blog was held back as the U.S. moved forward Wednesday, defeating Spain 2-0. In light of what happened, and for an even greater effect, maybe Bradley should have waited to vent until after yesterday's game ...

So what now for the U.S.? After the semifinal dust settles, there is a tournament to win. And Brazil -- no disrespect to South Africa, but I don't see an upset in the second semifinal -- should hold no fear for a suddenly confident group of players who just a week ago were played off the park by the Selecao.

For the first time in modern history, the U.S. has made the rest of the soccer world sit up and take notice. It feels pretty good, doesn't it? Now the challenge is for this group to grow in strength with a view to peaking one year from now. As great as beating Spain was, if the U.S. doesn't make it out of the first round of the World Cup in 2010, Wednesday will be nothing more than a great one-off result.

In my opinion, the U.S. currently is in a group of 20-30 countries that, on days such as Wednesday, can upset the world's best, and the U.S. must consistently beat the world's best if it is to take the next step up the international ladder.

Chances are that in 2010, the U.S. will face at least one powerhouse in group play, as well as a pair of teams against which it is fairly evenly matched. To bring it into context, given what we have seen recently, to get a chance to beat an opponent like Spain in a World Cup knockout round, the U.S. will have to beat an opponent like Egypt in the group stage.

What we have seen the past two games are displays that have to be replicated more consistently against non-CONCACAF opposition. Against Egypt and Spain, by doing pretty much every little thing right, coach Bob Bradley's men achieved something exceptional.

As with most things in life, if you get the basics right, success will follow. Take the goals that were scored. Charlie Davies and Clint Dempsey benefited from hard work, persistence and a readiness to gamble on being in the right place while Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore showed what can be achieved by making precise passes and moving off the ball.

Defensively, the U.S. was solid and, for the most part, in control. Against Spain, Bob Bradley preached the importance of containing Xavi, and the Barcelona man was kept in check, at least until Michael Bradley caught him with a late challenge for which he was somewhat unfortunate to be sent off (although, had he replicated his work of the previous 85 minutes and stayed on his feet, he would not have given Jorge Larrionda any need to consider going to his top pocket).

Behind a tireless midfield was a defense that put in a spectacular shift. Interceptions were well-timed and communication was constant, ensuring Spain rarely got on the wrong side. When that did happen, bodies were laid out with Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit and Ricardo Clark to the fore. Due to that, although his goal often was under pressure, Tim Howard was forced to make just six saves.

The past two games have showed this is a team that has to get its tactics spot-on in order to pick up wins against nations from the upper echelons of the game. Plans have to executed properly, from who is marking who on a corner to when is the best time to make a substitution.

Another thing the Confederations Cup demonstrated clearly is the difference between how this team plays when it scores the first goal compared to its approach when trailing. While there still is work to do in this area, the increase in the depth of the player pool should give Bob Bradley more ability to change systems and styles if the original game plan is not effective.

This tournament provided a breakout showcase for DeMerit and Davies, while the likes of Maurice Edu, Frankie Hejduk and Brian Ching will offer much when they return from injury. If Altidore, Freddy Adu and Benny Feilhaber can get some consistent playing time with their clubs next season, a roster stacked with question marks should become a squad with players who offer more options if Plan A falters.

However, now comes the hard part. We will get more of an idea Sunday as to whether this team can continue to consistently compete in high-pressure environments against quality opposition. After the Gold Cup (which, while important, is firmly in the second division of international competitions) comes another true test, as the U.S. faces Mexico at the Azteca on Aug. 12.

While the glory of Wednesday will take some time to leave hearts and minds, fans and especially players now must demand more. Only if it proves to be a launching pad for further improvement will beating Spain come to be seen as some sort of watershed moment. If performances do not continue to get better, a glorious day will come to be recalled as another false dawn.

Well played, man of the match

From an early age, Clint Dempsey has had to fight against the odds to fulfill his dreams. The Texan's story is well-known, and he credits the life lessons he learned as a youngster with helping create the player he is today. Given that, it should come as no surprise to see what he has done in the past two games.

One week ago, the majority opinion among fans and pundits was that the best thing for Dempsey was to take him out of the line of fire. How wrong we were. After struggling against Italy and Brazil, Dempsey found some form against Egypt and capped his display with the goal that clinched a semifinal spot.

It also was a performance that saw him climb to eighth in the tournament's player rankings, a position that raised a few eyebrows given his underwhelming start to the tournament.

If his performance against Egypt was an improvement on what he had done before, his man of the match display against Spain was as good as he has ever played in national team colors. At times, Dempsey has tried almost too hard to be the main man for the U.S., especially in games in which offense has been a problem. On Wednesday, alongside in-form teammates, his effort was well-directed and fantastically rewarded.

A thing that made me go, ""Hmmm""

What with all the fun and games going on in South Africa, it's hard to believe that six days after Sunday's final, the U.S.'s defense of the Gold Cup will begin against Grenada in Seattle.

While I have bagged the tournament as being substandard in terms of quality, compared to what the U.S. just competed against in South Africa, it is nevertheless another chance for Bob Bradley to run the ruler over a number of players who have put up their hands to be considered for a spot on the World Cup squad.

A preliminary Gold Cup roster released last week contained the names of 13 players who also were on the Confederations Cup squad. It is likely not all of those will accompany Bradley in hot-footing it from the Rainbow Nation to the Pacific Northwest, but hopefully those who do will include the attacking duo of Altidore and Davies, who should be given more chances to develop their promising partnership.

Adu also is likely to make the final roster, and this tournament could prove to be make-or-break for his immediate international future. Assuming he sees the field, he needs to show a more rounded game in order to get more chances. His talent is not in question, but his work ethic and maturity still are. If he does not take his chance, there could be few more pre-World Cup opportunities to impress.

Outside those who are doubling up in terms of tournaments this summer, I am keen for several members of the 2008 Olympic squad to be heavily involved in the Gold Cup. Among them, Michael Parkhurst deserves a chance to show, once again, that there is more than one way to play central defense, while Stuart Holden should win his first senior caps following his outstanding form for Houston."

We're minutes away from kickoff as the teams stand for the national anthems. The team captains, Casillas for Spain and Bocanegra for the U.S., commence proceedings by making a couple of statements decrying racism in world football. Can't argue with that. Wouldn't have minded seeing them denounce the Vuvuzelas too while they're at it.

By the way, the referee is Jorge Larrionda from Uruguay, U.S. fans might remember him from the last World Cup ...

1 min: We are under way and Spain immediately settles the ball and starts playing it around. Riera gets the ball early down the left, breaks to the byline and lays back an inviting cross across the 6-yard box that is cleared by the U.S.

2 mins: Donovan catches Ramos' heel as the Real Madrid man tries to go behind his back. Free kick in a dangerous spot, but Spain opt to play it short and wide to Cesc. His cross is deflected and spirals towards the U.S. goal, where Howard palms it over to be safe. The corner amounts to nothing for Spain.

3 mins: First corner of the day for the U.S. as Altidore wins it by banging the ball off Puyol. Donovan sends a deep cross which sees Casillas flap at it, but Capdevila heads clear.

4 mins: First yellow of the day, Donovan is late with a tackle on Alonso, who goes down. Certainly a foul, but a bit harsh to see a card for that. Moments earlier, a long ball down the inside-right channel had almost sent Davies free, but Casillas came racing out to clear outside his box.

6 mins: Almost a spectacular opening goal. Altidore and Dempsey combine nicely down the right and Dempsey dinks in a nice cross that Davies tries to overhead scissors kick into the net. That's a pretty good effort and the U.S. has started very well.

8 mins: Almost a goal again for the U.S. Dempsey gets the ball on the top of the box, turns and fires in a ferocious daisy-cutter that is this close to finding the net. Casillas was beaten there.

9 mins: Spain looks surprisingly nervous, but Cesc serves up a reminder of what they can do. Nice work down the left from Villa who knocks it back to Cesc, who unleashes a fierce 25-yard volley which soars over.

11 mins: Clark gives the ball away in midfield, the Spanish work it around on the left as Xavi and Riera play a neat little triangle. Riera dinks the ball past Dempsey and Spector into Cesc in the U.S. box. Cesc curls a pass to the far post looking for Torres, who volleys wide under pressure from Bocanegra. That was a pretty good chance for Torres, who seems to have his funk on. I can safely say I've watched nearly every game he's played in the last four years and you can usually tell from El Nino's early body language what type of a game he's going to have and whether he's going to score. He doesn't seem really up for this one so far.

14 mins: So far Villa and Torres have been very quiet, Villa picks the ball up deep and tries to play a one-two with Xavi but it's broken up by Bocanegra and cleared.

17 mins: Spain breaks and bypasses midfield with a swift ball out to Cesc on the right. Cesc dinks a chip into the middle which is gathered by Torres, who spins and gets off a quick snap shot that Howard does well to parry. It wouldn't have counted if he'd scored in any case, as Torres is flagged for offside. I don't think he was, but it's moot.

A wayward pass by Xavi as his pass to Fabregas is actually deflected by Villa to Donovan who breaks with the ball. Donovan is in acres of space and tries his luck from about 30 yards, but it's well wide.

21 mins: Spain almost strikes first. Ramos breaks down the right in acres of space, cuts into the box and tries to tee up Villa. After a series of deflected efforts, the ball ricochets out to Riera out wide on the left of the box. He's got lots of time, but opts to slam the ball across the box in a shot-turned-cross, when a gentle chip to the wide-open Torres would have been the wiser option.

24 mins: As expected, lots of possession for Spain, but so far not too much cutting edge. The Spanish are starting to look a little flustered.

26 mins: GOAL! U.S. 1-0 Spain. Dempsey and Donovan combine down the left, before Dempsey prods a ball to Altidore. Altidore shrugs off Capdevila with a spin, and places a shot past Casillas. It wasn't the most powerful of shots from Altidore, but Casillas was caught wrong-footed and was only able to palm it onto his own post and in.

29 mins: Spain still stroking it around, but there's no doubt they're a little shocked. Ramos sends a deep cross to the far end of the box to Villa, who traps it, cuts inside and unleashes a shot, but Spector is there to block and clear.

31 mins: Almost an equalizer for Spain. A long-range effort from Cesc bounces off Torres' heels and lands fortuitously at the feet of Villa. He's in the box with only one man to beat, cuts to his right but blazes wildly over.

35 mins: The U.S. has a free kick in a dangerous spot out on Spain's left. Donovan sends a perfect dipping pass to the far side of Spain's box which finds the head of Dempsey. It's a good chance for Dempsey but he heads over, with Bocanegra screaming at him to leave the ball. Bocanegra was in perfect position, that could easily have been two for the U.S.

37 mins: Fantastic approach play from Spain and Xavi which carves the U.S. defense open. Fabregas slides the ball in to Torres, who's wide open in the 6-yard box, but the pass is just behind him and a frantic U.S. defense scrapes it clear.

41 mins: Spain has a free kick just on the edge of the U.S. box to the left. Xavi tries to square it, but Donovan races forward to clear, but Spain work the ball back in and Villa bursts to the byline. He pulls it back and for a moment it looks like Ramos will sweep it home but Onyewu makes a clutch sliding tackle to clear. Fantastic defending from the big man.

44 mins: Torres almost single-handedly pulls Spain equal. He turns Bocanegra inside out down the left channel, blows into the box, and hammers a low left-footed shot goalbound to Howard's left. Howard stabs out his leg to parry and the ball is eventually cleared.

HALFTIME: U.S. 1-0 Spain.

Well, well, well -- it appears that the U.S. team's confidence was indeed justified. That was a magnificent first half by Bob Bradley's men. How the U.S. has gone from its shambolic loss to Costa Rica a few weeks ago, to matching Spain blow-for-blow is quite anybody's guess. If they play like this in the second half, we could possibly see a huge, huge upset.

46 mins: The second half is under way. You can tell the Spanish are flustered. Cesc just had an argument with Xavi over a misplaced pass. Right away, the U.S. puts Spain on its heels with a cross into the box, which Donovan gathers and squares across the box looking for Davies. Pique clears the danger and the U.S. has a corner which Dempsey does well to reach but heads over.

47 mins: Nice build-up again from Spain. Cesc gathers on the top of the box, slides it to Villa who unleashes a tremendous left-foot shot that appears as if it's arcing into the bottom left corner but Howard springs to his left and parries away. Great save, and from the ensuing corner, Alonso sidefoots a 25-yard curler just over.

50 mins: Spain controlling possession again. Xavi gathers on the edge of the U.S. box, he has Villa to his left and Torres to the right, but opts to try his luck instead. The shot deflects off DeMerit and it's a corner.

51 mins: The U.S. are defending very deep right now with Spain coming at them in waves and with lots of energy. From another corner, Villa gathers on the edge of the 6-yard box, switches it from his right to left foot but then slams his volley at about 1 mph straight at Howard. Spain's certainly not helping its cause with finishing like this.

53 mins: Possible penalty for Spain but the appeal is turned down. A delicate chip by Cesc almost sends Xavi free in the box, but he's bumped over by a trailing Donovan and falls over. Appeals all round, but Xavi looked suspiciously offside there in any case. Moments later, Riera drifts down the left, cuts inside Spector and with 4-5 players waiting in the box, slams a weak right-foot shot well wide. Bad decision-making again from Riera. David Silva on for Riera makes the most sense. For the U.S., a midfielder to replace Clark might be a good idea.

57 mins: Spain still dominating possession but still not getting anywhere. After what seems like forever, Xavi finally tries to prod the ball into the box looking for Torres, but Donovan makes a nice interception and breaks with the ball. He tries to send Davies free down the right, but Pique comes over to make the tackle.

59 mins: You can tell Spain is really starting to get desperate now. Villa picks the ball up outside the box, about 30 yards out, he steams forward with Torres running into space but opts to try a long-range effort that goes wide. He could have sent Torres clear there. The U.S. come right back with a long ball which reaches Altidore in Spain's box, but he's muscled off it by Puyol.

62 mins: Spain again with clever approach play, Ramos' chip into the box finds Villa, who lays it off to Riera. Riera winds up and slams a shot goalbound but DeMerit with a heroic block. Spain comes right back as Ramos stings Howard's palms twice in succession from long range and forces the U.S. keeper to make back-to-back saves. The U.S. is barely holding on here.

65 mins: Riera breaks past Spector down the right and pulls the ball back. It runs past everyone to Ramos who's rushing into acres of space and Ramos winds up, but his shot is blocked by a sliding Clark. Great defending yet again. Santi Cazorla is warming up for Spain.

67 mins: Donovan is practically playing center back now. Cesc dribbles past Bocanegra on the left in the box, gets to the byline and chips it back, looking for Torres, but Donovan is there to head clear. The U.S. make a sub, Benny Feilhaber on for Davies. Presumably Dempsey will move up front again as he did against Egypt.

69 mins: The U.S. makes its first sortie into the Spanish half for what seems like the first time in ages. Dempsey holds the ball up on the edge of the Spanish box, and lays it out wide to Donovan. Donovan's chip to the far edge of the box is too long for Feilhaber.

70 mins: An upset is looking more and more likely. I'm not sure the U.S. has the legs to last through extra time, so if its going to win, it'll be in regulation time. Twenty minutes for Bradley's men to hold on.

72 mins: Riera again with the ball out left, slides it in looking for Torres, but DeMerit is there to put off the Liverpool man and the ball bounces out of bounds. DeMerit has been outstanding today.

73 mins: GOAL! U.S. 2-0 Spain. Pandemonium. Feilhaber breaks with the ball, feeds Donovan in space outside the Spanish box. Donovan opts not to shoot and prods a pass into the box. It evades everyone, but Ramos dawdles with the ball in the 6-yard box, and Dempsey comes from behind to come in and put it away. Horrendous mistake by Ramos who incurs Casillas' wrath, and great hustle from Dempsey.

75 mins: Believe it people, this upset is happening. I can't see Spain coming back from this with just 15 minutes on the clock.

77 mins: Mata comes on for Riera as Spain roll the dice. In the meantime, Xavi is taken down outside the box by Feilhaber. Villa winds up but hits a soft effort straight at Howard. It must be said that Villa has been poor today, as has Riera.

80 mins: Cazorla down the left, tees it up for Alonso outside the box, who unleashes a fierce first-time shot that is, unfortunately for Spanish fans, straight at Howard.

82 mins: Eight minutes from glory. Ramos crosses into the box as Capdevila tries to get on the end of that, but is called for an infringement. Casey is on for the U.S. to replace Altidore.

84 mins: Mata, who's looked lively, down the left again and sends in a deep cross which Onyewu does well to clear. From the corner, Villa gets the ball with his back to goal in the 6-yard box and tries to dribble around three U.S. defenders, but not surprisingly fails.

86 mins: The obligatory red card for the U.S. comes out and it's for Michael Bradley, which means he'll miss the game against Brazil on Sunday. I'll have to see a replay to get a better idea of that one. On first thought, I'd say it was very dubious, but possibly a yellow from a strict ref.

87 mins: From the free kick, Spain work it into the box, it's half-cleared several times, falls to Puyol in the 6-yard box, and his shot is blocked by DeMerit and Onyewu simultaneously.

88 mins: Yellow for Pique. Not that it matters much at this point. This game is pretty much done, Spain's goose is cooked. This is a stunning result.

90 mins: Three minutes of stoppage time until glory for the U.S. I'm guessing Altidore will see some more playing time for Villarreal this season.

90+2 mins: The U.S. continues to defend heroically. The bus has been parked and Spain doesn't look like it can break down the U.S. defense.

FULLTIME. U.S.2-0 Spain.

An unbelievable upset. I don't think Spain can have much complaints about that result. La Roja dominated possession but save for a couple of half-chances, didn't really create a clear-cut chance. As for the U.S., after Altidore's goal, it went into prevent D mode, but it worked and Dempsey snatched the killing blow.

Man of the match goes to frankly the entire U.S. team which defended like demons and made multiple heroic blocks -- but the center back tandem of DeMerit and Onyewu stood tall.

Is that the biggest win of all-time for the U.S.? Since it's not the World Cup it'd be hard to say that, but it's certainly the most impressive result in recent memory for U.S. Soccer. Fantastic heart shown today by the U.S. and if you're a U.S. soccer fan, tonight you need to party hard and call into work sick tomorrow.

That's all from me folks, Brazil (most likely) is next up on Sunday.

Lineups

The team lineups for the game have been announced as follows:

For the U.S.:

GK: Tim Howard

D: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit, Carlos Bocanegra

M: Clint Dempsey, Ricardo Clark, Michael Bradley, Landon Donovan

F: Charlie Davies, Jozy Altidore

It's the same lineup that beat Egypt, except Howard is returning in goal instead of Brad Guzan, and Bocanegra is playing left back. Bob Bradley obviously decided that Jonathan Bornstein's defense on the flank has been a little shaky.

For Spain:

GK: Iker Casillas

D: Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila

M: Cesc Fabregas, Xavi, Xabi Alonso, Albert Riera

F: David Villa, Fernando Torres

There have been a lot of pregame comments from both teams leading up to this game. Spain, befitting its status as overwhelming favorite, has been brash, arrogant and some would even say downright overconfident.

""The U.S. has very good players,"" midfielder Riera said.

If that statement wasn't enough to fan the flames, midfield general Xavi certainly pulled no punches in providing more bulletin-board material.

""I think their [the U.S.] football has evolved. In the friendly, they did some things that complicated us. They've improved their level, especially offensively, they have some great players and it won't be an easy game,"" Xavi said.

It's simply a shame that the U.S. team gets no respect from the Spaniards.

""You have to respect the United States,"" midfielder Pablo Hernandez said.

On the other hand, the U.S. team, as befitting its status as David in a David versus Goliath scenario, has been modest, humble and eager to remain low-key.

""Maybe it's their time to lose,"" Davies said.

""I think we can match them physically, do some things with the ball in attack,"" said midfielder Sacha Kljestan from his vantage point on the U.S. bench.

Of course, as with all sporting events, talk is cheap -- we'll see what happens when the two teams meet on the field in what promises to be an absorbing contest. It's safe to say that if the U.S. can pull off the upset, it will shock the footballing world, and if any U.S. player is plotting or hoping for a big-money move to a top European side, today's the day to show his wares.

In other trivia before the match starts, I've been alerted by reader Jesse that these days, the bar at Craven Cottage is named ""McBride's Sports Bar"" in honor of Brian McBride.

How cool is that? As for McBride, the word is that he's recently indicated that he is open to returning to the U.S. national team if the coaches want him. This of course is a huge debate for another day, but off the top of my head, I'd say bringing him back into the fold would be a good move. After all, whom would you rather see coming on as a sub -- Conor Casey or McBride?

Pregame banter

To sum up the rather extraordinary events of Sunday's Confederations Cup action, I'm just going to start with the following e-mail I received from Adrian in Seattle:

Ms. Paris Hilton appointed ambassador to UNICEF. An unusually flustered Hilton composed herself in time to offer this stunner, ""I just feel with all my heart that every animal deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and that is why I have agreed to accept this appointment. Because I know I can bring great things to bear on these unfortunate pets."" One correspondent was overheard saying, ""You know, she might actually help.""

After the U.S. team's epic 3-0 win against Egypt on Sunday, the Americans will face a powerhouse Spanish team on Wednesday (2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN, ESPN360.com) in a game which is simply a must-see for every self-respecting U.S. soccer fan in this country.

The two teams have, of course, met as recently as last summer, in a friendly which Spain won 1-0 in Santander. The circumstances will be different this time as both teams will be going full-speed and will have key players (Landon Donovan for the U.S.) available in this match that didn't play last time around. Moreover, Spain is in the process of rewriting the history books with a current 35-game record-tying unbeaten streak and a record-breaking 15-game win streak. Vincent Del Bosque's men will be keen to extend that against the U.S. and are clearly taking this tournament very seriously. Unlike other teams I won't mention, it's doubtful the Spaniards have spent the past few days before a game frolicking in their hotel with persons of dubious distinction. If its current form wasn't intimidating enough, Spain also has the advantage of an extra day's rest.

Should the U.S. pull off an upset win, you could certainly make a good case for it being the most impressive win (in the modern era) in U.S. national team history.

The big question is how to deal with the polished technical machine that is Spain and its clinical possession game. On the plus side for the U.S., Spain isn't quite at full strength in this tournament -- it's missing a ball-winner in midfield and in particular Marco Senna. It's also missing creative genius Andres Iniesta, comfortably one of the best five players in the world at present.

On the other hand, Spain is blessed with the best set of strikers in the world -- Fernando Torres and David Villa, neither of whom made an impression last time around against the U.S. (Villa didn't play and Torres was playing with a heavily sprained ankle and subbed at halftime), and fantastic midfield depth. The Spanish are also a hard team to prepare tactically for since Spain flits comfortably through various formations.

Even in this tournament alone, Spain has switched between a standard 4-4-2 with two wingers, a 4-4-2 with only one pure winger in Albert Riera (somewhat bizarrely preferred by Del Bosque to David Silva) and Cesc Fabregas in a free role and a 4-1-4-1 formation designed to control possession. If Spain does have a small weakness, it's in the gaps that its attacking fullbacks (Sergio Ramos and Joan Capdevila) leave behind and also the lack of a pure ball-winner in Senna's absence.

As for the U.S., does coach Bob Bradley stick with the 4-4-2 lineup and two-striker pairing of Charlie Davies and Jozy Altidore that worked wonders against Egypt (presumably bringing back Tim Howard in goal instead of Brad Guzan) or does he tinker with a three-man central midfield to try to stymie the Spanish possession game? There's a chance the U.S. could get overwhelmed in midfield if it plays with just two central midfielders, but if Bradley reverts back to a single striker lineup, he could lose out on the offensive thrust that was discovered against Egypt. What's his decision going to be? Who knows, but this is why Bradley gets paid to make the critical call.

Quote of the day

""There's always someone, this country's renowned for that. Someone will always criticize you, no matter what. If I let that affect me then I'd never be where I am today. Yes I'd prefer people to say nice things about me, it's not like I've murdered anyone. You've got to be thick-skinned I suppose.""

To the surprise of all, that's not actually PR-savvy, fan-friendly U.S. midfielder Michael Bradley speaking, but England's Michael Owen, a player who's faced just a tiny bit more media scrutiny during his career than Bradley, speaking last week about what he thinks of criticism from media and fans.

That said, if being overly sensitive to fan and media criticism will drive the U.S. team to consistently play with the heart and hustle it showed against Egypt, U.S. fans will gladly persist unabated.

After all, it is in no way normal for most soccer nations to cast a deeply critical eye on their national team. Would the younger Bradley prefer a return to the Stone Age of soccer in the U.S., when everyone, including the media, was apathetic about what the U.S. did on the international stage?

I'll be back when the game starts with a play-by-play.

For those of you unable to watch the game live, you can catch a replay of it tonight at 11 p.m. ET on ESPN2."
84,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4277897/count/81/the-magic-cure-all-red-bulls,The magic cure-all for the Red Bulls,"I don't know where to begin on this blog. For one of the few times in my life, I'm at a loss for words. On top of that, I'm walking around like Rain Man. Last week, as I was leaving for practice, my neighbor asked me if the garbage truck had arrived yet, to which I responded ""two wins."" As he stepped closer and asked again, I said ""10 losses"" before finally yelling at him ""NO COMMENT.""

No Comment? Who says that? I'm losing it. This was after a night in which my almost 2-year-old son woke up screaming every two minutes because he has his 20th ear infection, and his quack doctor won't send him to a specialist yet. According to her, he needs to have 50 in a month before she will consider having tubes put in. She's probably thinking about the green she will be losing if we go to someone else.

At least I had an unbelievable surprise waiting for me when I got home, something every man should have, a 250 horse-power, engine-fueled, fire-red power washer. It was a Christmas present from my Dad that was finally delivered, and it couldn't have come at a better time. If there was one thing I was in the mood to do, it was shooting water at 500 mph out of a mini machine gun, attached to an engine powerful enough to fly the Red Bulls to our next game. As I began to pull at the starter cord with all my strength, I chuckled thinking of a number of referees I'd like to have lined up along the fence to pummel with my water Uzi. My version of the red card!!! I'm kidding. Relax, I love referees.

Where was I? As I started the water cannon, I felt a Zen-like calmness take over my body, but as I began to shoot holes through my fence (didn't know about the pressure control knob), my Zen started to fade and I reverted to Rain Man and thinking about our season. Maybe I should bring my trusted Water Assaulter 2K9 (just named it) to practice tomorrow, and the supporters can come down and blast us when we miss a sitter or get scored on.

If there is one thing I have learned throughout my life, it's to be accountable, so I'm not hiding, pointing fingers or making excuses. What you are seeing is bad soccer. It doesn't matter if we have good players, which we do, there have been many teams in many sports who have won championships with mediocre players. So, when you have talent and you do not live up to it, that's a shame and a waste. So, if you hear about an unusually high injury rate for the Red Bulls in the coming weeks, it's probably the work of some passionate supporters with the Aqua Bazooka (new name) in their hands."

The teams are on the field and warming up. We're close to kickoff. Everyone keeps talking about how the U.S. has a point to prove. If anyone has a point to prove, it's probably Egypt. Despite running Brazil ragged at times and beating Italy, the Pharaohs are still being referred to as ""scrappy"" and a ""hustle"" team -- where in actuality, Egypt is a very technically gifted team that plays great counter attacking football.

1 min: We're off.

2 mins: First break of the day, DeMerit misjudges a header and the ball is headed over Spector to Abdelghani, who's wide open on the top of the U.S. box and slams a left-footed horribly wild and wide. You have to wonder just how much Egypt will miss the injured Zidan today.

3 mins: Al Muhamadi torches Bornstein down the right and sends in a very dangerous cross that somehow eludes everyone in the box.

4 mins: Altidore draws a free kick about 40 yards out in a central position. Dempsey winds up and tries a long-range effort that hits the wall, loses velocity and drifts to El Hadary.

6 mins: First corner of the day, Spector plays it in to Clark, who tries a left-footed shot that is blocked out. Donovan's corner is caught on the fly by El Hadary, who tries to set Aboutrika free on the break with a long throw, but it's too far ahead of him.

9 mins: Clark tees up the ball on the left sideline from a throw-in and tries a 40-yard shot at an acute angle that goes about 40 yards wide. That's an embarrassing effort, the likes of which have not been seen since Joaquin Phoenix grew a beard, donned hipster shades and tried to rap. Not to mention, wildly optimistic.

11 mins: Dangerous move from Egypt, a nice give-and-go on the left flank and Eid sends in a nasty-looking cross that Onyewu does well to clear. The Pharaohs get the ball back and earn a phantom free kick in a dangerous spot out on the left after a dive. From the resulting free kick, it's a comedy of errors in the U.S. box, with the U.S. defenders taking about 25 attempts to clear and about six Egyptians dithering on the ball in the 6-yard box and refusing to shoot. From the clearance, the U.S. break into the Egyptian box and Bradley draws a fine save from El Hadary with a fierce low drive. End-to-end stuff.

15 mins: Long ball forward from the U.S. from Dempsey finds Donovan, who chests the ball down and beats his man. He's all alone one on one with El Hadary and inexplicably decides to square the ball across the box and it's clear. Obviously he thought Altidore was with him, but at the same time, he was clean through and should have shot.

16 mins: With the wide-open style on display here from both teams, this game is likely to see quite a few goals. In the meantime, Eid earns a corner.

17 mins: The Egyptians go with a short corner and Aboutrika curls a dangerous cross across the U.S. box to Shawky. Shawky's all alone as the U.S. central defenders go to sleep, but heads the ball wildly over.

18 mins: The U.S. play it around nicely, it's worked to Davies on the edge of the box, and he unleashes a shot that cannons off an Egyptian defender which goes out for a throw-in.

21 mins: GOAL U.S. 1-0 Egypt Quite possibly one of the ugliest goals in U.S. history but U.S. fans will take it. A seemingly harmless cross from Altidore on the left is mishandled not once, but twice by El Hadary, who also suffers the ignominy of getting the ball kicked out of his hands by his own defender. Meanwhile, Davies, who was lurking in the area and gets ahold of the ball and pokes it in from a few yards out, off El Hadary's face in fact.

23 mins: We've had two minutes of stoppage as the trainers tend to El Hadary who's still down -- probably due to the fact that he also appeared to get kicked in the head from Fathi.

26 mins: El Hadary appears to be OK, although he's been given a massive bandage already for his head.

28 mins: Donovan goes on a fantastic run, beating Al Muhamadi in midfield, splits two Egyptian defenders and is clear in the box, before El Hadary comes out and makes a great save to strip the ball from him as Donovan tries to take it around him.

30 mins: A couple of minutes of sustained pressure from Egypt. Back-to-back crosses into the U.S. box looking for Eid, who fails to connect both times. It's then followed up with a nicely worked piece of approach play which splits the U.S. defense, before Aboutrika tries to bend the ball into the U.S. goal with the outside of his foot, but Guzan saves.

33 mins: Eid works down the right again, but only manages to dribble out of bounds when a cross was there for the taking. To say that he's failed to fill Zidan and/or Zaki's shoes is probably an understatement.

34 mins: Another Egyptian cross from wide, and again the U.S. defenders look very sketchy as they try to clear.

36 mins: Dempsey loses the ball twice in quick succession right outside the U.S. box, both times Egypt send in crosses that fail to find its forwards. What on earth is wrong with Dempsey? Elsewhere on the field, Spector earns a yellow taking down Shawky on the sideline. Probably a harsh card as Shawky's awkward landing made that tackle look worse than it was.

38 mins: A fantastic effort from about 30 yards about from Hosni, who launches a piledriver that beats Guzan all ends out, but just whizzes over the bar and misses by this much.

40 mins: Eid and Muhamadi work the U.S. left again with a clever one-two which leaves Muhamadi all alone to send in a dipping cross. DeMerit clears. Both U.S. flanks are looking very shaky right now.

41 mins: The Egyptians break again after the U.S. loses the ball in the Egyptian third. Aboutrika sweeps it left and the cross is sent deep over Eid's head. Eid falls over yet again looking for another penalty. That's the second time he's done that today, he should get a booking for that.

44 mins: Brazil is 3-0 up right now over Italy -- if the U.S. can find two more goals from somewhere, they could be headed for a date with Fernando Torres and Co. at this rate.

45+1 mins: Bradley sends a nice long ball to free up Davies. Davies breaks clear and slams a vicious effort goalbound and forces El Hadary to parry it away. Davies has looked very lively so far.

45+2 mins: Spector loses the ball out on the right to Eid as he's muscled off the ball (and probably fouled), then Eid breaks into the U.S. box and tries to pull it back in the 6-yard box but Onyewu cuts it out.

45+4 mins: Donovan's really starting to come into this game now as his confidence grows. First he almost sends Davies clear down the inside-right channel with a nice pass. Then, moments later he dribbles past Gomaa at the top of the box before trying to slip the ball through to a wide-open Bradley, but it's just the wrong side of him.

HALFTIME: U.S. 1-0 Egypt.

A strong first half for Bob Bradley's men, who've looked very promising going forward, albeit suspect defensively down the flanks. Davies has added good pace and movement to the U.S. front line and Donovan's been getting the ball in space, with time to run.

As for Egypt, Aboutrika and Co. seem to have underestimated the U.S. team and displayed none of the vigorous running and energy shown against Brazil and Italy. You'd have to expect that Pharaohs' coach Shehata will give them the hairdryer treatment in his halfitme speech.

46 mins: The second half is under way.

47 mins: Spector takes a throw-in but falls down and loses the ball. Egypt breaks, but just as they threaten on the top of the U.S. box, Shawky seems to hesitate before smacking a shot that takes a couple of deflections before drifting wide.

48 mins: Michael Bradley picks up his 575th career yellow card. Although in this case, it's a bit harsh since he actually didn't make contact with a late sliding tackle. Then again, at least he didn't get a red.

49 mins: Egypt makes a sub and takes off the hapless and toally ineffective Eid. Hassan comes on for him.

51 mins: Altidore has a shot cleared off the line! Dempsey leads a break, threads the ball through to Davies who pulls it back to Altidore on the top of the box. Altidore hammers it goalbound and it beats El Hadary, but is cleared off the line by Said. Appeals for a handball -- it did hit his hand, but only after it cannoned up off his thigh. Although that wasn't an intentional handball, you really have to give the penalty there since Said's hand prevented the ball from going into the net.

53 mins: In the interim, Fathi, who was largely responsible for the U.S. goal is stretchered off after coming off worse for wear in a collision with Dempsey.

56 mins: Bradley with another long-range effort to draw another good save from El Hadary.

58 mins: Egyptian corner. It's headed clear by Onyewu, who has been dominant in the air today.

60 mins: Egypt might need to use their third and final sub. Abdelghani is limping heavily and is taken off for Abougrisha. The Pharaohs are now down to literally their sixth-choice striker. Moments earlier Abdelghani almost went out in a blaze of glory after latching onto a through ball from Aboutrika -- except for the fact that (A.) he was glaringly offside and (B.) Guzan made a great save regardless.

62 mins: GOAL! U.S. 2-0 Egypt. Bradley leads a break from midfield, a nice give-and-go with Donovan, who plays it back to him and Bradley finishes with a nice sliding effort from about 15 yards out. Great stuff from Bradley and cue all the Father's Day sentiment etc. etc.

65 mins: I wouldn't put it past the U.S. to score a third here, the Egyptians look deflated.

66 mins: Benny Feilhaber is coming on, I'd guess for Dempsey, who's looked flat again today.

67 mins: Altidore gets the ball on the edge of the Egyptian box with his back facing goal, he twists and turns and beats Gomaa, before sending across a dangerous looking cross that Egypt clears. That's going to be his last contribution. Feilhaber comes on for Altidore.

70 mins: GOAL! U.S. 3-0 Egypt. Spector carries the ball down the right and sends a long ball deep to the back of the Egypt box, it's met by Dempsey, who heads it home. Amazing stuff, the U.S. is on the verge of making the semifinals if results stay the same (by virtue of equal goal difference with Italy, but having scored more goals).

72 mins: Feilhaber tries to repeat his Gold Cup heroics of a few years ago. He chests down a ball and hammers a volley but it's straight at El Hadary.

74 mins: Egypt are trying to rally here. Another raid down the flanks, and a cross comes in from the left and falls nicely at Aboutrika's feet. He tries to place it inside Guzan's left post but Clark dashes across to block. From the corner, Onyewu clears yet again.

79 mins: Egypt is maintaining possession, but not really doing anything with the ball here. I can't see them scoring.

81 mins: Casey in for Davies.

82 mins: Muhamadi is booked for a rather dirty challenge on Donovan. He actually leaped in the air and attempted to elbow Donovan in the back of the head, but failed to connect. The Egyptians look very frustrated.

86 mins: Dempsey makes a furtive run down the left and centers, but El Hadary is out swiftly to gather. He tries to kickstart a break by Egypt but there's only one player up top for Egypt. Looks like Egypt's given up the ghost in this game.

88 mins: Corner kick for Egypt, headed away by Casey. The ball is played back in and Gomaa misses a header from point-blank range. He'd nipped in behind Onyewu and ahead of Bornstein in the 6-yard box and really should have planted his header home, but headed wide and high.

90 +1 mins: We're into injury time and Brazil-Italy is a final. If the U.S. holds on, it's headed to the semis.

FULLTIME: U.S. 3-0 Egypt. It's all over. The U.S. have pulled out all the stops in remarkable fashion and the Azzurri did themselves no favors by capitulating against Brazil.

It was a comprehensive win by the U.S. and coach Bob Bradley who answered all their critics in resounding fashion. An excellent performance against a very good Egyptian side. Man of the match is a toss-up between Onyewu, who was dominant at the back today, Michael Bradley, who had a very good game in central midfield, and Donovan, who had another good game. Up next, Spain and its 35-game unbeaten streak on Wednesday.

Lineups

The lineups for both teams are in, and are as follows:

U.S.

GK: Brad Guzan

D: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit, Jonathan Bornstein

M: Clint Dempsey, Ricardo Clark, Michael Bradley, Landon Donovan

F: Jozy Altidore, Charlie Davies

Egypt

GK: El Hadary

D: Ahmed Farag, Hani Said, Ahmed Fathi, Wael Gomaa

M: Hosni, Mohamed Shawky, Al Muhamadi

AM: Mohamed Aboutrika

F: Ahmed Abdelghani, Ahmed Eid

For the U.S., it looks like a basic 4-4-2 -- but, yet again there's no Jose Torres or Freddy Adu. On the bright side, coach Bob Bradley has decided to give Altidore some help up front and it's not the lumbering Conor Casey, but Swedish league speedster Charlie Davies.

On the downside, still no playing time for Adu (who's probably questioning his decision not to play for Ghana these days), Torres (who seems to be the inadvertent scapegoat for the Costa Rica loss a couple of weeks ago) and the bizarre decision to start Guzan instead of Howard. I'm really not sure what the point of switching out Howard is, especially if the U.S. is trying to win the game. If you're trying to experiment and try out youth, then why does the rest of the lineup look more or less like the lineup from the first two games. And if you're trying to win and keep with the same basic shell, why on earth are you taking out your best player in Howard? Bradley's lineup choices get stranger and stranger ...

Pregame banter

Well, after a week in South Africa that most U.S. fans probably would like to pretend never happened, the U.S. is set for its final group-stage match, against Egypt on Sunday (2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN2/ESPN360.com). As things stand, the U.S. is still mathematically alive for a semifinal berth -- all that needs to happen is Bob Bradley's men beat the Pharaohs by at least three goals and Italy loses to Brazil by four goals. If that sounds like a tall order, you're right. It's a sequence of events that is about as likely to happen as Paris Hilton becoming the next UNICEF ambassador.

As for Egypt, this is an impressive team that has dominated play in Africa and the African Nations Cup for years yet somehow continually fails to qualify for the World Cup. It's no real surprise to me that Egypt pushed Brazil hard and managed to beat Italy. Hassan Shehata's men play a very technical counter-attacking game, with good defensive discipline.

The Pharaohs also can count on the skills of attacking midfielder Mohamed Aboutrika, considered by many to be the best player in the world not currently playing in Europe or South America. Aboutrika, who constantly has shunned offers from Europe to continue playing domestically in Egypt for Al-Ahly, is a gifted playmaker, dubbed by fans as the Egyptian Zinedine Zidane. Where that leaves star Egyptian striker Mohamed Zidan is anybody's guess, since he is after all, technically also the Egyptian Zidan. Unfortunately, Zidan has been ruled out of the game against the U.S. with a hamstring injury he suffered against Italy, leaving Egypt without its two big-name (and very talented) strikers (Amr Zaki was ruled out just before the tournament started).

So can the U.S. take advantage of the fact that Egypt will be without two of its three biggest weapons? Bradley has indicated that while he'll make some tactical and personnel changes, he's leery of committing to a gung-ho attacking approach. Although fans clamor to see the young players such as Charlie Davies, Freddy Adu and Jose Francisco Torres, I believe the fact that the U.S. is still ""alive"" and the desire to avoid a third embarrassing defeat mean Bradley likely will take very few chances with his lineup. Does that mean the embattled DaMarcus Beasley will see the field and be given a chance for a career reinvention the likes of which have not been seen since the talentless Spencer Pratt became a born-again Christian? Unlikely, but you never know.

I'm predicting Bradley will come out with a 4-4-2 lineup along the following:

GK: Tim Howard

D: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit, Jonathan Bornstein

M: Clint Dempsey, Benny Feilhaber, Michael Bradley, Landon Donovan

F: Conor Casey, Jozy Altidore

Historically, the two teams have only met once at senior level, with the U.S. losing 3-1 on June 8, 1987. At the junior level, Donovan, Beasley and Onyewu were part of the U.S. squad that was knocked out of the 2001 FIFA U-20 World Cup in the second round by Egypt (a 2-0 loss). In the 2005 U-20 World Cup, the U.S. (with Feilhaber, Kljestan and Adu) beat Egypt 1-0 in group play.

By the way, to answer all the e-mail questions I've received about whether Bradley is on the hot seat -- I certainly think he should be, and were this any other soccer power in the world, he probably would be.

However, as I mentioned Friday, a well-placed source in the world of U.S. soccer has told me Bob Bradley's job is not remotely in jeopardy at this point. Will that change if the U.S. suffers heavy defeats against Egypt and Mexico (Aug. 12)? Who knows? Nothing in life is certain, but as of today and right now, Bradley apparently has nothing to worry about.

I'll be back on Sunday when the game starts for a live play-by-play."
86,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4271538/count/81/dumb-dumber,Dumb and Dumber,"As everyone who read Jen Chang's play-by-play for the U.S team's 3-0 loss to Brazil is aware, I actually had a bad feeling about this game (from a Brazilian perspective). But I clearly underestimated the mess that is U.S. soccer right now. The 2002 World Cup really does seem like eons ago.

I still maintain the U.S has never faced a more beatable Brazil side, in a competition in which Brazil supposedly brought its best squad. But the American approach in the first half was utterly mind-boggling, as was the insertion of DaMarcus Beasley into the starting lineup. Criticizing Beasley is getting to be like beating a dead horse, but if ever a player has come to symbolize the shortcomings of a program, it's him. And yet, even with Beasley firmly implanted in Maicon's pocket the entire first half, there was still hope.

If coach Bob Bradley had done his homework, he would've found that Brazil's left side has been a sieve under Dunga, partly due to the absence of a left-sided midfielder in the rookie manager's formation, and partly due to his bizarre penchant for fielding mediocre players at the left-back position, such as Andre Santos.

Not until the 80th minute, with the outcome no longer in doubt, did the U.S. exploit this weakness, in the play that culminated with Benny Feilhaber smacking a shot off the crossbar, following a nice exchange by Landon Donovan and Jonathan Spector. Then again, on the doing-your-homework front, one might have expected the U.S.'s marking to be a bit better on Brazil's first set-piece opportunity, considering Brazil was coming off a game against Egypt in which it scored three goals off set pieces.

A recurring criticism of Dunga's team has been that it defends too deep in its own half, affording the opposition plenty of time to knock the ball around and invariably create scoring chances. Gilberto Silva plays almost like a third central defender at this point in his career, and is no longer the ""Invisible Wall."" He's just plain invisible.

I've watched -- ""endured"" might be more accurate -- every Brazil game under Dunga, and the only other sides apart from the U.S. NOT to take advantage were a Kuwait select team, in a friendly back in October 2006, and a Peru team that isn't even trying anymore, in a World Cup qualifier earlier this year.

Everyone else from Wales to Algeria to, would you believe, Canada has caused Brazil problems. Indeed, it is fairly accepted back home that the only reason this team currently sits atop the South American standings is the incredible, bordering on inhuman, form of Julio Cesar. Did he even have to make a save Thursday?

While the gulf in class was apparent from the start, the U.S. and Brazil have more in common than you think: Each team is saddled with a coach who is in way over his head and commits costly mistakes on a regular basis, but a comfortable position in qualifying means neither one is in serious trouble.

The difference is Dunga has actually imparted some positive qualities to Brazil. I'm not quite sure what Bradley has brought to U.S. soccer over the past three years.

Perhaps the biggest indictment of this program's development was the reaction of the Brazilian media and fans to Thursday's match. The performance was largely dismissed based on the caliber of the opposition -- I certainly haven't changed my mind about anything I've written about Dunga in this space.

It wasn't supposed to be this way after the 2002 World Cup. By now, beating the United States should mean something. The fact that it still doesn't tells you major changes need to be made. And since you can't fire the players ..."
87,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4266343/count/81/wins-wanted-us,Wins wanted for the U.S.,"""Gutsy display."" ""Competed well with 10 men."" ""Gave the world champions all they could handle.""

Admit it, how many of you are fed up with the U.S. gallantly losing to the world's soccer superpowers? Hands up if, after yet another close-but-no-cigar display versus a footballing giant, you felt that the national team is no closer to actually winning one of these games?

While some cheerleaders in the media again laud the national team for another plucky effort, among fans, it seems that patience is wearing thin at the continued existence of the U.S. at the plateau on which it has been standing for almost a decade. Playing well and losing is not an option anymore.

Before looking ahead to Brazil, let's go back to Monday's defeat versus Italy. Giuseppe Rossi was the story, but beyond that dominant headline were a number of subplots, which offered a microcosm of where the national team currently stands and showed what lessons have to be learned.

To me, the argument that playing down a man makes the result more acceptable is flawed by historical evidence. Three years ago, the U.S. held an Italian team that was en route to winning the World Cup to a 1-1 draw, despite playing with a numerical disadvantage for almost the entire second half. The Italy that won 3-1 on Monday is, in the words of its coach, Marcello Lippi, a year away from being at a level he believes could get them again crowned world champions. Thus, if anything, the gap has gotten bigger.

Ricardo Clark deserves some sympathy, but he should have known better, just like Pablo Mastroeni should have known better in 2006. Knee-high tackles like Clark's are ill-advised after the ball has gone, and it was not a shock to see the red card. Of course, Fabio Grosso's elbow moments later was similarly egregious, but the debate over refereeing consistency is one for another day. Clark's challenge would have been a red card in MLS, where he plies his trade.

The biggest shame of Clark's dismissal was that, until that point, he had been at the forefront of an excellent opening half hour for the U.S., during which time it could have gone two-up. Unfortunately, both Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore failed to take advantage of golden opportunities. It was interesting to compare their lack of composure in front of goal to Rossi's showing within two minutes of entering the game.

While I am of the opinion that Bob Bradley gets excessively criticized at times, it is true that he was not without blame for the goals that Italy scored. Halftime saw little cover alteration for the loss of Clark as the midfield anchor, and with Italy increasing its possession and pressure, the back four withdrew deeper and deeper as the midfield struggled to stem the blue tide.

One replay of Rossi's first goal showed Jay DeMerit called ""step,"" a request none of his teammates acted upon. It was a similar story for Italy's second goal. Daniele De Rossi was allowed to drive into space before firing home from distance. True, there were few natural, ball-winning replacements for Clark, but Italy's ascendancy was related more to a lack of positional alterations.

The boys versus Brazil

So, having faced the current World Cup holders, the U.S. now takes on the most successful nation in the history of the sport. Not that Brazil looked anything like that in their narrow opening game win over Egypt.

The U.S. should take notice of the way the African champions were able to attack the Selecao in different ways. Each of Egypt's goals was different and highlighted some weakness in the Brazilian back line, but the question is, does a U.S. team that has had trouble scoring from open play in three games have what it takes to pose similar problems for Brazil?

Landon Donovan's performance against Italy was encouraging, and the captain has the chance to shine again against a Brazil side that struggled to deal with Mohammed Aboutrika, who plays in a similarly deep-lying role for Egypt. Jozy Altidore created problems when facing goal in the opening game, and he has to find a way to make that a more consistent part of his game. The U.S. also desperately needs an improved return from the crossed ball.

Though starting Conor Casey could help achieve both those things, personally, I expect Bradley to retain a similar lineup to the one he started against Italy. With Clark banned, Sacha Kljestan will likely step in, although Jose Torres may also have a chance. If Carlos Bocanegra is fit, he will replace DeMerit.

Looking beyond Brazil, any experimentation by Bradley is likely to be held back until the U.S. faces Egypt, especially if there is no semifinal spot on the line. Freddy Adu may get a start, possibly in place of Clint Dempsey, who looks very tired. I would also like to see Charlie Davies get a start to see if he can replicate the energy he has shown off the bench in recent games.

Well played, most valuable man

Count me among those that thought it would be difficult for Guillermo Barros Schelotto to sustain his 2008 form, which culminated in an inspirational display in the MLS Cup. When the Crew went winless in its opening four games, it seemed that the defending champions had been afflicted by a starting slump similar to that of Houston after each of its recent championships.

Nine victories later, Columbus is within three points of D.C. United, who leads the East, with a game in hand. During their current run, in which the Crew has claimed 17 of 27 available points, Barros Schelotto has scored eight of his team's 15 goals. To further emphasize his importance, of the five go-ahead strikes he has made, three have proved to be game winners.

In 13 games this season, the 36-year-old Argentine already has three more goals that he tallied last year, when assists were the dominant part of his game. Through the Crew's struggle in the early days of Robert Warzycha's reign, Schelotto's move from provider to predator has revitalized his side, and put him in the frame to become MLS' first back-to-back MVP.

A thing that made me go hmmm

Thanks goodness for Schelotto, whose scintillating form was the most positive highlight of another MLS weekend dominated by controversy.

The battle of the Eastern Conference's top two sides featured two more questionable penalty calls, each side benefited from decisions made by refereee Baldomero Toledo. First, Jon Busch was penalized while trying to make a save on a Chris Pontius strike. Sure, the Fire goalkeeper left his feet, but the reaction of the D.C. players -- none of whom instantly claimed a spot-kick -- suggests that they saw the incident as nothing more than a normal coming-together.

Toledo did not, and he was at it again later in the game when Dejan Jakovic brushed the arm of Patrick Nyarko. It's unlikely a foul would have been called in the NBA, let alone MLS, and the term ""make-up call"" leapt to mind. Not that it did Chicago much good. Josh Wicks saved Brian McBride's subsequent penalty to preserve D.C.'s lead.

While all this was happening in the nation's capital, similarly, strange events were occurring in Kansas City, where, in a first half that featured five fouls, four cards were shown. In addition to three yellow cards, New England's Emmanuel Osei was sent off for flicking a leg at Claudio Lopez, following a foul by the Argentine.

True, by kicking out Osei, regardless of the force of the gesture, was running the risk of incurring Ricardo Salazar's wrath. But seriously, a red card? Why not show a yellow and keep 11 men on each side? Sending a player off for something that probably happens several times a game was a little over the top. To put it in context, would MLS have retroactively punished Osei had he not been carded? I doubt it."

We're a few minutes from kickoff.



The teams are walking onto the field for the national anthems. The U.S. is 1-12-0 (W-L-T) all-time against Brazil.

1 min: We're off, and the ball is kicked backwards to Onyewu, who hoofs it up the left sideline and Lucio knocks it back to his keeper Cesar.

2 mins: First corner of the day, it's for Brazil, but it's headed clear by Donovan.

3 mins: Long ball forward by Brazil almost catches the U.S. back line sleeping as Robinho had burst clear past Bornstein. The ball's just too far for him though.

4 mins: Kaka goes on his first weaving run of the day, beating two U.S. players off the dribble down the right sideline and earning a corner. I'm probably in the minority here but I don't think Kaka's quite the player he was a few years ago - his knee problems have cost him a little bit of pace and he can no longer breeze effortlessly past 4-5 players on long, winding runs anymore. Having said that, it's such a minor flaw, it's like pointing out that Megan Fox's thumbs are ugly. He's still an incredible player. The corner was cleared easily by the way.

6 mins: GOAL: Brazil 1-0 U.S. Brazil earns a dubious free kick out on the right. Maicon curls in a superb cross to the far back post and Felipe Melo is there to power the ball home. He snuck in past Spector.

8 mins: The U.S. has yet to string together any passes past halfway.

9 mins: A long punt by Howard finds Donovan in the Brazilian half, he tries to surge forward but is dispossessed by Silva. He looks for a foul call but there's none forthcoming, that was a pretty clean challenge.

10 mins: Another run by Maicon down the right earns Brazil a free kick. The delivery is low and cleared but Beasley gives the ball away just outside the box and the ball is played back into Fabiano in the penalty area. Fabiano turns Bornstain and squares dangerously across the 6-yard box but the U.S. clears.

13 mins: Brazil are stroking the ball around right now. The ball is passed swiftly to Kaka who breaks into the U.S. and rounds Kljestan to the byline but his pull back is blocked. From the corner, the U.S. clears at the fifth attempt. Sketchy defending all round there.

14 mins: ""Is Beasley the most overrated U.S. player of all time?"" asks an e-mail from Scott in Chicago, who clearly seems to think there are people out there that rated Beasley in the first place.

15 mins: Kljestan chips the ball out to Donovan on the right wing, but Santos steps in and takes the ball smoothly away from him. Donovan's first touch there was poor.

16 mins: OK, I admit I'm being harsh on Beasley, he was very good in the 2002 World Cup where he showed a penchant for darting, explosive runs down the flank. I wonder what happened to those runs? They'd make a good subject for a VH1 ""Where Are They Now"" documentary.

18 mins: A throw-in from near the Brazilian box by Onyewu turns into a swift counter by Kaka, who takes the ball from the edge of his box all the way to the U.S. area, before trying a slide-rule pass to Robinho. Robinho can't get there and tries diving instead.

19 mins. GOAL: Brazil 2-0 U.S. Shocking mistake by Beasley. Donovan and the U.S. have a short corner and the ball is played short to Beasley who fails to control the ball and lets it run under his feet to Santos, who clears it to Kaka. Kaka flips it to Ramires, who breaks the length of the field into the U.S. box. Brazil have a 2 on 1 counter with only Spector back for the U.S., Ramires squares to Robinho, who is all alone in the box and slots it coolly past Howard.

21 mins: The U.S. are being penned down in their half again, but Onyewu makes a nice tackle on Ramires on the box and clears out to Altidore down the left. Altidore tries to run at Lucio but fails to get past him.

23 mins: The feed from South Africa has gone down, so we're as much in the dark as you right now.

24 mins: Still waiting on the feed ... a recent scientific study has shown that boys who have a so-called ""warrior gene"" are more likely to join gangs and also more likely to be among the most violent members and to use weapons. In 2006, the controversial warrior gene was implicated in the violence of the indigenous Maori people in New Zealand, a claim that Maori leaders dismissed. If this warrior gene does exist, I wonder if there's a soccer equivalent. Are American players missing a ""goal-scoring"" gene?

25 mins: And we're back on air!

Bradley gets stripped of the ball in midfield by Fabiano, who breaks to the edge of the U.S. box, tries to go 1 on 5 and slams a shot well wide off the mark.

28 mins: The U.S. are having major problems trying to get the ball out of their own half or even stringing passes together. In the meantime, Brazil are strolling around like it's a Sunday rec league game.

32 mins: U.S. wins a corner. Donovan drives it high into the middle, but there's only Brazilian defenders there and they clear. The ball is knocked back in to Donovan on the right wing, who's hounded by Lucio. Donovan knocks it back to Bradley, who has time and space on the edge of the box, but lofts a poor cross into the box. Brazil clear and begin to break, but Melo is scythed down by Onyewu, who earns a yellow for his troubles.

35 mins: Silva is brought down by Kljestan in midfield. So far Kljestan's contributions have consisted of either fouling someone or giving it away. From the freekick, the ball is squared to Robinho who tries a hopeful 35-yard effort that goes well wide. Moments later, a long ball down finds Fabiano wide open down the right. His first-time shot on the half volley is weak though and Howard gathers easily.

38 mins: Nice sequence there for the U.S. First, Spector muscled Kaka off the ball deep in his own half and played it up to Donovan who beat a couple of Brazilians and dribbled up the right flank before releasing an overlapping Spector. Spector's final ball was poor though and Brazil clear.

39 mins: Maicon gets the ball in acres and acres of space on the right side. He sends in a dangerous cross that find Silva in the box but the header is well over. That was a good chance for Silva.

41 mins: Robinho dribbles on the sideline with Onyewu and Bornstein closing him down. Onyewu brings him down needlessly and it's a free kick in a dangerous area. The ball from Maicon finds Melo all alone at the far side of the box, but his shot is whiffed. Probably should have been another goal.

43 mins: The U.S. has lacked the ability to move the ball on the ground in this game and as usual has resorted to hopeful and forlorn long punts. It's also safe to say that the obvious solution is to bring in either Torres or Adu, two players who like to get on the ball, can actually control it, and even better, can pass it.

HALFTIME: Brazil 2-0 U.S. Well, it's safe to say that the U.S. was totally outclassed in the first half by a Brazilian team that doesn't even look like it's had to get out of first gear. The gulf in class is obvious, and at times the U.S. team has resembled a bunch of traffic cones watching Brazil pass the ball in cirlces around them. It looks pretty bleak, but if the U.S is to have a chance, it's going to have to pressure the Brazilians on the ball more, and either Adu or Torres needs to come into the game.

46 mins: Connor Casey is on for Beasley. Donovan presumably moves to left midfield. Not the most inspiring tactical move by Bradley. What about the non-existent central midfield? No question Beasley needed to be taken off though.

47 mins: A rare bad touch by Kaka, who miscontrols a pass just outside the U.S. box. I was just thinking that Kaka's one who would make an ideal subject for E! ""True Hollywood Story."" First he was young and good looking, then he was good looking and incredibly talented at soccer, then he was good looking, incredibly talented at soccer and incredibly rich.

48 mins: The U.S. has a brief chance, a ball flighted into the box and Casey chests down. However his control is poor and he's unable to get a shot off. Moments, later, the U.S. comes right back with Altidore playing a nice one-two with Casey before teeing up a left-footed shot that goes well over. Better from the U.S. Much better stuff from the U.S. now.

50 mins: The U.S. actually finding space and keeping possession now. Another nice build-up leads to a Michael Bradley long-range effort, but that's also well off the mark.

51 mins: Kljestan proves that he's not the wayward passing turnover machine that many fans think he is. Just now he connected with a delicate six-inch back pass to Onyewu with unerring accuracy.

53 mins: Long ball over the top from the U.S. almost leads to a chance for Altidore, who's beaten in a foot race by Miranda and loses his footing to boot. Brazil comes right back with a nifty move which frees Kaka outside the box to unleash a vicious shot that Howard does well to beat away. In the meantime Kljestan hacks down Ramires, who's being stretchered off. He's lucky to escape a booking there.

55 mins: Oh, I spoke too soon. It's a delayed card, but a red nonethless. Kljestan is sent off. Chivas USA fans will be used to that sight. That's pretty much game and set and match. When will U.S. players learn to control their discipline and stop with these ludicrous late challenges? Granted, it's been a harsh decision to send them off, but they shouldn't put themselves in that position in the first place.

60 mins: Feilhaber is on in the meantime for Altidore. The only thing that sub says to me is that Bob Bradley has gone into damage limitation mode.

61 mins: GOAL Brazil 3-0 U.S. Beautiful run down the right by Maicon who dribbles past Bornstein, plays a give-and-go with Kaka, and then slams the ball past Howard from an acute angle. It might have taken a slight deflection off Bornstein.

63 mins: Brazil knocking it back and forth like a training session now, before finally making a move down the right with Maicon centering a dangerous-looking cross that Donovan heads clear. To be honest, Donovan is the only U.S. player who hasn't looked out of place on the field today.

65 mins: Sending out a page for Clint Dempsey, looking for Dempsey, looking ... looking ...

66 mins: Maicon gallops past Bornstein again down the right and slides is a cross that's barely cleared.

68 mins: Brazil makes a double sub -- Kaka off, Julio Baptista on. Fabiano off, Nilmar on. Nilmar is a fantastic prospect at striker, by the way. This should be interesting. On the field, Donovan whips in a nice arcing cross that Bradley can't get on the end off. That was a decent half-chance for the U.S.

69 mins: Lucio is subbed off and replaced by Luisao.

71 mins: Brazil free kick on the left side, driven in, and Howard makes a two-fisted clearance with authority.

72 mins: Dempsey touches the ball!!!!! I repeat, Dempsey touches the ball. Actually, he makes a nice move and dribbles past two Brazilians in midfield before trying on one too many and losing it. He falls over looking for a foul, but even Pablo Pozo wouldn't give that. Although he's been invisible today, at least he showed some fight there, which is more than can be said for Casey, who's moving around with the pace of a constipated 75-year-old man. Aren't subs supposed to bring energy?

75 mins: The pace of the game has slowed to a crawl, as Brazil appears content to shut it down.

78 mins: A rare excursion forward in the last 10 minutes for Brazil, and the ball is played in to Baptista, but Howard reads well and comes out to gather.

81 mins: Spector gets the ball at midfield and pushes up the right flank. He looks around but doesn't see anyone who wants to overlap. In the end he passes it to Casey, who promptly fails to control it, and Brazil clears.

82 mins: Superb play by Spector, who carries the ball down the right again, nutmegs Santos, plays a one-two with Donovan and then pulls it back to Feilhaber. Feilhaber cracks a stunning shot from just outside the box that crashes onto the underside of the Brazilian cross bar and then bounces out. Desperately unlucky for Feilhaber and the U.S.

84 mins: End-to-end stuff now with gaping holes appearing on both sides of the field. Robinho runs onto a nice ball from Santos in the box, but looks too tired to do much with it. He cuts back and tries to cross, but Michael Bradley is there to block and clear.

86 mins: Dempsey earns a free kick down the left. He made a nice move around Luisao, and the Brazilian had no choice but to bring him. Free kick in a dangerous spot. Donovan curls it in, and Casey meets it with a thumping header that cannons off the Brazil cross bar. Again, that's very unlucky for the U.S.

89 mins: The South African fans look pretty exuberant. Their ability to continually honk the horns is unmatched. Impressive endurance for sure.

90 mins +2: Nilmar is brought down just outside the box by a sliding challenge from Feilhaber. It's in a dangerous spot, and the Brazilians are quibbling over who gets to take it. Baptista waves everyone off authoritatively and then tries to sidefoot a curler. It's a shockingly bad attempt and well over, a sight that's familiar for Arsenal fans worldwide.

FULLTIME: Brazil 3-0 U.S. It's all over. The U.S. was comprehensively outplayed, and the team's limitations were exposed. Of course, you also have to question Bob Bradley's odd decision to start Beasley and Kljestan.

U.S. fans might point to the two late strikes against the woodwork, but they'd be fooling themselves -- I think it's pretty obvious that Brazil went walkabout after its third goal. Man of the match for the U.S. probably would be Donovan if one had to choose someone. He showed exceptional work rate today across the entire field and was the only U.S. player able to show any real semblance of rudimentary skill, like controlling the ball.

Preamble/Lineups

Morning all. The official lineups for the game have been announced as follows:

U.S.

GK: Tim Howard

D: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Jay DeMerit, Jonathan Bornstein

M: Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Sacha Kljestan, DaMarcus Beasley

F: Landon Donovan, Jozy Altidore

Brazil

GK: Julio Cesar

D: Maicon, Lucio, Miranda, Andre Santos

M: Felipe Melo, Kaka, Ramires, Gilberto Silva

F: Luis Fabiano, Robinho

I just spoke to David Mosse, who, in his typically bleak outlook on Brazilian soccer these days, predicted a 2-1 victory for the U.S. Of course, that was before he saw the Brazilian lineup, which he described as ""terrible."" It's worth noting that Mosse always thinks Brazil is going to lose. If Dunga & Co. were playing the Fiji Islands today, he'd predict a loss. On the flip side, die-hard U.S. fan Andy Glockner (former ESPN.com college basketball editor and now SI.com scribe) thinks Brazil is going to win 4-1. Then again, it's worth noting that Glockner always thinks the U.S. is going to lose. With fans like these ...

Pregame banter (June 17)

With Monday's 3-1 loss to Pablo Pozo still stinging the memory, the U.S. gets the dubious pleasure of facing Brazil next (Thursday, 9:55 a.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360). I say dubious, because the U.S. needs at least a tie from this game, or it faces elimination from the Confederations Cup. Daunting though the task might appear to be, the reality is that under Dunga, the current edition of the Selecao is nothing like your father's Brazil (unless, of course, you happen to a 3-year-old kid and your father's first memory of Brazil was the exceedingly dour '94 squad).

Under the extremely pro-defense Dunga, Brazil is attempting to blend European discipline with its traditional flair and skill. To achieve this, Dunga has a penchant for selecting workmanlike journeymen-level players (by Brazilian standards) and eschewing the likes of Sao Paulo's Hernanes in favor of the pedestrian talents of players like Mineiro and Josue, while relying solely on the dynamic duo of Kaka and Robinho to break the game open. Those expecting Brazil to play its notable sweeping brand of attacking, dynamic football haven't been watching the way Brazil has played under Dunga the past couple of years. It's a sentiment shared by a majority of the Brazilian pundits, who have spent much of this time in ""See no evil, hear no evil, speak in favor of Dunga's firing"" mode.

Even so, a mediocre-by-its-own-glorious-history Brazil is still a formidable opponent for any top team in the world, let alone the U.S., which so far seems intent on replicating its performance the last time it was placed in a ""Group of Death."" Based on its 2006 World Cup formula, the U.S. is scheduled to open the tournament with a three-goal defeat or thereabouts (check), then pull off an epic draw in the second game against the group favorite (possible), before capitulating in the third game against an African opponent (in this case, Egypt).

As for the U.S. lineup, captain Carlos Bocanegra is a distinct possibility to return from injury, while Ricardo Clark is out, of course. With left back Jonathan ""I almost scored an unbelievably incompetent own goal"" Bornstein looking like Mauro Camoranesi's personal plaything on Monday, and DaMarcus ""Out of form since 2005"" Beasley failing to make the transition to left back, could we see the re-emergence of Heath ""I'm not even in the first-team squad for a second division German club"" Pearce? Of course, I'm in no way implying that the U.S. is in crisis mode at left back.

This is the lineup I think coach Bob Bradley will go with:

GK: Tim Howard

D: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Carlos Bocanegra, Heath Pearce

M: Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Sacha Kljestan, Landon Donovan

AM: Benny Feilhaber

F: Jozy Altidore

I'll be back on Thursday with a live play-by-play of the game (dependent as usual on server speed)."

We're moments away from the start of the game. The teams are out on the field and captains Donovan and Buffon exchange pleasantries.

And we're off. The U.S. is playing in white tops and white shorts.

1 min: Italy kicks off and the ball drifts out to Bornstein, who clears it. Bornstein's starting again instead of Beasley, which is probably a huge relief for U.S. fans. These days, ""Beasley is in the lineup"" are five words that along with a date citing Kelly Clarkson's song ""I Do Not Hook Up"" are possibly the two things that a red-blooded U.S. male fan dreads hearing the most.

3 mins: Poor control by Gross on the sideline almost allows Feilhaber to sneak in and break down the ltalian left, but Chiellini cleans up.

4 mins: The two teams are still feeling each other out -- Altidore had the ball down by the corner flag just now and beat two Italian defenders with a nifty bit of skill before Italy regained the ball.

5 mins: Camoranesi surges forward in midfield and tries to send Gilardino free with a probing pass but DeMerit reads it and makes a nice interception. U.S. clears.

6 mins: A long ball from the U.S. down its left looking for Dempsey goes out of bounds. Moments later, Altidore draws a free kick after Gattuso halts his run with one of his trademark tackles. It's a free kick for the U.S. in a dangerous position out on the edge of the Italian box.

8 mins: Donovan pushes it short to Dempsey who winds up and unleashes a shot that will end up as a nice souvenir for one of the fans in the crowd.

9 mins: Nice build-up by Italy, Pirlo makes a nifty turn and tries a slide-rule pass to Iaquinta, who tries to break in behind the U.S. defense, but DeMerit is up to the task and matches him for pace before clearing. From the throw-in, Camoranesi receives the ball wide open in the U.S. box but with several Italian attackers waiting in the box, he shanks his cross well over.

11 mins: De Rossi takes a page out of the U.S. book and hoofs a long ball up to Iaquinta on the edge of the U.S. box. Iaquinta nods it back to an on-rushing Gilardino who sizes it up and welts a tame shot along the ground which won't trouble Howard.

15 mins: Pretty tame stuff so far from both sides. I spoke too soon, Camoranesi breaks again with the ball and goes past two U.S. players (Clark and Spector) before clipping a pass to the far post which Onyewu clears.

16 mins: Dempsey collects the ball on the left wing, looks up and sends a nice cross-field pass to Altidore, who's open on the U.S. right. Altidore gathers the ball and runs at Grosso before deciding to slide it to his left to Spector, who's making a late run. Spector is summarily dispossessed by Chiellini. I think the U.S. would have been better served with Altidore taking it on or shooting to be honest.

18 mins: The U.S. knock the ball around nicely in midfield before Clark decides to try and thread the eye of a needle. In a plan so cunning, it's not been seen since Tokyo residents decided to fight increased crime by planting more flowers, Clark sends a ball through the middle of the Italian defense to ... absolutely no one.

19 mins: Bornstein gets a yellow out on the left for bringing down Camoranesi, who's looked by far the most dangerous player on the field. Pirlo sends in a dangerous whipping free kick which finds Legrottaglie all alone in the six-yard box and he heads it wide. That was a golden opportunity there and a huge miss.

22 mins: Dempsey is down hurt, he was clattered from behind by Zambrotta after laying off a nice one-touch pass. Play is stopped and the U.S. returns the ball to Italy after the Italians sportingly hoofed it out of play.

25 mins: Great play by Bradley in the middle of the field as he lays a thumping tackle on Pirlo and feeds Donovan. Donovan carries before sliding it back to Bradley, who's got time and space in the Italian penalty area but hits a weak effort straight at Buffon. Promising stuff from the U.S players, who appear to be standing around admiring their handiwork as the Italians counter straightaway. Pirlo slips the ball through to Iaquinta, who's wide open in acres of space but also miles offside.

28 mins: The lively Camoranesi wins a corner. The Italians take it short and Camoranesi curls it to the back post where Legrottaglie heads it down into space but Howard gathers.

29 mins: Another opportunity for the U.S. Donovan carries the ball and sends Altidore clean through -- Altidore has a great chance but decides to try and square it back across to Donovan but his cross is weak and cleared by the Italians. Again, Altidore was too unselfish there -- he seemed to be in two minds there, kind of like Bruce Willis who went from divorcing Demi Moore to shunning monogamy to deciding to remarry.

30 mins: This is end-to-end stuff now. The Italians break and Gilardino has the ball on the edge of U.S. box with only DeMerit to beat. He tries to feint him to his left and take him off the dribble, but Onyewu catches up from behind and takes the ball cleanly off him in the box. Gilardino executes a perfect triple Salchow for good measure, but the ref's not having any of it. Moments later, Pirlo lines up a free kick from 30 yards and line drives a one-hopper that Howard mishandles momentarily, but recovers.

33 mins: RED CARD for Ricardo Clark. Shades of Pablo Mastroeni from 2006. Clark slides in and makes a reckless late challenge on Gattuso. There's no doubt it's a yellow, but it's an absolutely ridiculous decision to give a red for that -- that's shockingly bad, even compared to MLS officiating. Making it even more egregious is the fact that it's Clark's first foul of the day, but even so Clark has to shoulder some of the blame for a pointless late challenge in a nonthreatening position.

35 mins: Another long ball forward from the U.S. looking for Donovan, who's stopped in his tracks by an elbow from Grosso. This is a good opportunity for the U.S. but Donovan sends his free kick about 15 feet wide right. Poor effort there.

38 mins: The Italians put the ball in the net -- well actually Bornstein does, in what would have gone down as an epic blunder -- but fortunately for the U.S., Camoranesi is called for offside as the pass was initially played in.

39 mins: Penalty for the U.S. Feilhaber releases Altidore with a beautiful pass into the Italian box. Altidore turns inside Chiellini, who pulls him down and the ref has no qualms about giving the penalty.

40 mins: GOAL! U.S. 1-0. Donovan slides it home to his right as Buffon dives the wrong way. The U.S. go up despite only having 10 men.

41 mins: The U.S. has its tail up now. Bradley takes a lash from outside the box, a swerving shot with some power that's unfortunately straight at Buffon.

43 mins: Almost an equalizer from Italy as Zambrotta tries a speculative 25-yard shot that goes narrowly over. Nice buildup there as Pirlo played it in to De Rossi at the top of the box, before De Rossi flicked it to Zambrotta.

45 mins: Pirlo releases Grosso down the left and the fullback tries to beat Spector to the byline, but the U.S. defender is up to the task and clears for a corner. The corner doesn't amount to much and there's the whistle.

HALFTIME: U.S. 1-0 Italy.

A great first half for the U.S., who showed a lot of energy and confidence and was undoubtedly hard done by with that atrocious red card on Clark. As for Italy, I don't know what Lippi is thinking right now. The Italians spent most of that half trying to attack through the air against the U.S. defense, an odd approach considering it's the U.S.' strong point, not to mention Toni is on the bench. The Italians currently have only one player on the field (Camoranesi) who has the capacity to trouble U.S. defenders with his ability to run at them. They need to get Rossi on the field for the second half. As for the U.S., it's a hard ask for 10 men to hold out for 60-odd minutes, but we'll see.

46 mins: The second half is under way, no changes for either team yet.

Grosso with another run down the left and he wins a corner. The first corner is cleared out for yet another corner. Pirlo's inswinger is headed out by Dempsey.

48 mins: De Rossi has the ball at midfield, looks up and chips it forward to Gilardino who heads back to Iaquinta. Iaquinta shows some nimble feet to beat one U.S. defender and tries to wriggle into the box before DeMerit makes a vital challenge.

50 mins: The Italians are continuously being described by commentators as ""experienced."" Personally, I think it's just a flat-out old lineup and it shows in their lack of energy. They need some infusion of creativity off the bench since right now the Italians look devoid of ideas. Iaquinta had a chance to send Gilardino free with a slide-rule pass but overhits it badly. Leaden foot doesn't even begin to describe the lack of touch on that pass.

52 mins: Altidore earns another free kick as he's brought down by Zambrotta. Another dangerous opportunity for the U.S. but Donovan's cross is low and headed out. Spector's follow-up effort is charged down.

54 mins: Italy continues to press down the U.S. right with Grosso. It seems to be their only outlet right now, but Spector's doing a great job shutting down that flank. A double sub is forthcoming for Italy -- Montolivo for Camoranesi and Rossi for Gattuso.

57 mins: Italy is dominating possession right now, no surprises there given the Azzurri's one-man advantage, but they have yet to create a chance.

58 mins: GOAL U.S. 1-1 Italy. A dagger in the heart of U.S. fans everywhere. Rossi picks up the ball after dispossessing Feilhaber in midfield, strides forward and unleashes a stunning 35-yarder which finds nothing but net. Somewhere far, far, far away in another Galaxy, a cranky Jedi master named Yodarena must be thinking, ""Wrong we were about the young Padawan. Recruit harder, him we should.""

61 mins: Italy breaks again, and Grosso slides the ball into the inside-right channel for Iaquinta, who runs into the box and turns and hammers a cross but Onyewu clears it, albeit with a shaky miscue.

62 mins: A fleeting chance for Italy as Rossi misses a chance for his second. Pirlo curls a cross to the back of the U.S. area, where Zambrotta heads it down to Rossi. Rossi is wide-open about 12 yards out but blazes his half volley about 20 feet over.

65 mins: The U.S. is bringing on Charlie Davies for Altidore. That's a very strange substitution by Bradley. Why take off Altidore, whose size and speed was giving the Italian defenders all sorts of problems?

66 mins: Iaquinta latches onto a ball in the U.S. box and runs at Onyewu before laying it back to Gilardino, who shows why AC Milan gave up on him by lashing a wild shot that ends up looking more like a wayward cross.

67 mins: It's all Italy now, as Pirlo unleashes a pile driver from outside the box that Howard can only parry straight back out. The ball falls out to Iaquinta, who cuts it back inside Onyewu and with a chance to hammer it home smashes it wide and high.

69 mins: Italy sub -- Luca Toni on for Gilardino, who's been nonexistent. The U.S. needs fresh legs in midfield, it looks gassed and the Italians are having all sorts of time and space.

70 mins: DaMarcus Beasley is getting ready to come on for the U.S.

71 mins: GOAL! ITALY 2-1 U.S. De Rossi picks up a loose ball about 35 yards out in a fairly innocuous position and unleashes a vicious low drive that beats Howard. Looking at replays, it seems his vision was clouded by Onyewu, who probably should have cleared that but whiffed on his attempt. In the meantime, Beasley replaces Feilhaber.

74 mins: Almost a third for Italy. A dangerous whipping corner from Pirlo finds Toni in the 6-yard box, but his glanced header is wide.

75 mins: Pirlo's controlling the tempo of this game now, not surprising given the vast amount of time he's been given on the ball. Can't really blame the U.S. players though, they're clearly tired. Grosso tries to take on Spector again down the right and is yet again repelled.

79 mins: Dempsey tries a speculative shot from about 25 yards out, it's a lazy drifter which Buffon makes a total meal of, applying the famed camera-save technique to it.

80 mins: Bradley sends the ball forward for Davies who holds the ball up and lays it back to Dempsey who chips it into the box towards Donovan. However, Legrottaglie takes a flying leap and climbs all over Donovan. That was a careless challenge, some refs would give a penalty for that and if the ball wasn't about 6 feet over Donovan's head already, it probably would have been given. Even so, the Italians are fortunate to escape with that.

83 mins: Rossi dribbles down the right and wins a corner. Pirlo whips in another dangerous cross, trying to find Chiellini, who heads over.

84 mins: Sacha Kljestan is warming up. In the meantime, Dempsey sends a long ball forward again for Davies but the pass is overhit and goes out of bounds. The Italians try to counter but Onyewu brings down Iaquinta in midfield. Kljestan on for Bornstein.

87 mins: Nice sweeping move from Italy pushing forward down the left, with Grosso sending in a beautiful chip that tees up Toni 6 yards out. The header is weak though and straight at Howard. That should have been three for Italy there.

88 mins: Kljestan almost pulls off a moment of magic, cutting in from the left sideline and curling a 25-yarder just over the bar. That wasn't a bad effort at all, a little unlucky.

89 mins: Beasley earns the U.S. team's first corner with a run down the left. Donovan sends in a great cross which finds Davies wide open in the 6-yard box but Davies' effort is poor and well over.

90 mins: Howard keeps the U.S. in the game. Pirlo slips Rossi free in the box but Howard comes out fast to close him down and block his shot.

92 mins: Another save from Howard. The Italians break as the U.S. is caught with numbers forward. Pirlo threads the ball through the U.S. center backs and finds Toni breaking all alone and one-on-one with the U.S. keeper, who stands his ground and blocks the shot. Good save from Howard, but Toni should have nailed that.

93 mins: GOAL! Italy 3-1 U.S. That man Pirlo again at the heart of things. He waltzes past a tired DeMerit on the sideline and drifts to the byline before cutting the ball back into the box to Rossi, who shows no mercy with a great half-volley finish past Howard who had no chance.

FULL TIME: Italy 3-1 U.S.

Game over. Pirlo ran the show in the second half and obviously Clark's sending off hurt the U.S. Can't really fault the U.S. team too much here, Bradley's men had the better of the chances in the first half and with more assertive finishing from Altidore and Michael Bradley could easily have led by more than one goal.

The second half was all Italy though, the introduction of Rossi and Montolivo was pivotal and the U.S. team ran out of gas, while coach Bradley didn't really seem to have any answers tactically. If not for Howard, the final score could have been uglier -- as is, it's still a harsh score line and not really reflective of the U.S. team's effort. Man of the match for the U.S. was probably Spector shading Donovan, while for Italy, it's a toss-up between Pirlo and Rossi.

Pregame banter (Sunday, June 14)

As the U.S. prepares for its rather tasty matchup against Italy (Monday, 2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN360.com), I'll be here once again with a live play-by-play during the game. But more on that later.

I'll start by briefly addressing the Jermaine Jones situation because some people seem to have misconstrued my earlier thoughts about him.

First, I think it's clear to all and sundry that Jones immediately becomes the top central midfielder in the U.S. pool (assuming the FIFA paperwork goes through smoothly). That much is obvious, and as such, he ranks above Michael Bradley, Maurice Edu, Ricardo Clark and Pablo Mastroeni in the pecking order.

However, I will reiterate my belief that some fans might be overestimating how much Jones will bring to the table. He undoubtedly enhances the lineup, but at the same time, it's not as if the U.S. is upgrading from, say, Clark to Michael Essien or Marcos Senna. So if people are expecting a world-class holding midfielder who can both break up plays and link the midfield to the forwards, they'll be disappointed, because technique and creative passing are not Jones' strong points. Plus, and we won't really know how big an issue this is until it all shakes out and Jones gets some call-ups, but you also have to consider how his presence may affect team chemistry. In this instance, I'm not talking about chemistry on the pitch, I'm talking about off the field, if Jones' reputation for being ""temperamental"" holds true.

Anyway, enough about Jones and on to the game against Italy. I think we'll see U.S. coach Bob Bradley opt for a one-striker alignment something along the lines of:

Goalkeeper: Tim Howard

Defensemen: Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Dan Califf/Jay DeMerit (whoever wins out), Jonathan Bornstein

Midfielders: Clint Dempsey, Clark, M. Bradley, Landon Donovan

Attacking midfielder: Benny Feilhaber

Forward: Jozy Altidore

I'm intrigued to see how this game pans out. There's no doubt that Italy took the U.S. lightly before the teams met back in the 2006 World Cup -- and who could blame the Italians after the U.S. team's opening-game debacle against the Czechs? This time around, the Azzurri have been making the right noises, saying they're better prepared and won't underestimate the U.S. It'll also be interesting to see whether the U.S. will come out again with a very physical approach and pressure the Italians on the ball high up the field as they did in '06, when they really troubled Italy initially.

As for Italy, it's not all rosy in its camp with the news that captain Fabio Cannavaro has been ruled out of the game. With backup Nicola Legrottaglie also doubtful, it's likely that Alessandro Gamberini will earn the start. However, that's actually not the good news for the U.S. The good news is that Cannavaro's absence increases the likelihood that the walking defensive liability otherwise known as Liverpool's Andrea Dossena could see some action. Dossena recently mentioned that he would ""run to Juve"" if the Old Lady was interested in buying him. Not to worry, Dossena, I'm sure that plenty of Liverpool fans will happily drive you to Turin ASAP, free of charge.

Other than that, some interesting subplots for Italy in this game include:

Whom will Italy coach Marcello Lippi deputize as captain for this game? Will it be a wily veteran like Gigi Buffon or Gennaro Gattuso, or will he opt for the cerebral, even-tempered influence of Daniele De Rossi, a mature, serene presence who is in no way likely to get himself sent off? Speaking of De Rossi, now that Brian McBride is gone and McBride clone Brian Ching is out, he must be sorely disappointed.

Will Giuseppe ""the U.S. shouldn't chase around 18-year-old players who can't get games for their club team and tell me they want to play for Italy"" Rossi get the start at forward, and how will he celebrate if he scores against the U.S.? What's the betting that he channels his inner Bruce Springsteen and rips off his jersey to reveal a T-shirt underneath that says ""Born in the USA?""

On the other hand, young starlet Rossi could be distracted by all the transfer rumors linking him to Juventus, which hopes to pair him with new acquisition Diego, the brilliant but enigmatic Brazilian playmaker. However, it's worth noting that Diego's international stock has dropped lately, as he wasn't selected for the Selecao's Confederation Cup roster on the back of a middling season in the Bundesliga. The whispers out of Germany indicate that Diego's form was badly affected by his on/off dalliance with German pop star Sarah Connor. Personally, I think the real question is, what did Sarah's son John and her ex-boyfriend, Kyle Reese, think about Diego's shabby treatment of her?

I'll be back Monday when the game starts."
90,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4254232/count/91/a-home-away-home,A home away from home,"A few belated thoughts from the U.S. team's 2-1 win over Honduras:

Not a proud moment for U.S. soccer when John Harkes credited the team for taking the sting out of the crowd at Soldier Field. Some of the American players were probably longing for Saprissa. Short of playing every home qualifier in Columbus, I don't really have a solution, but the lack of a home-field advantage continues to be a frustrating subplot to these games.

As for the match itself, far too much was made of the effort of the U.S. in relation to the game against Costa Rica. Every team, when it gets dominated technically and tactically the way the U.S was in Saprissa, gives off that deer-in-the-headlights vibe. The players are confused and shell-shocked, which is often mistaken for a lack of effort.

Manchester United gave off the same vibe in the Champions League final against Barcelona. Even players such as Ji-Sung Park and Carlos Tevez, known for their incredible work rate, appeared strangely apathetic. I sincerely doubt either Park or Tevez wasn't giving his all in the most important match of the year, just as I don't believe any American takes the field for a World Cup qualifier and doesn't care about winning.

Although I criticized Clint Dempsey in last week's podcast for not bringing to the U.S. side the same lunch-pail attitude he does for Fulham, it is more an issue of how he interprets his role on each team. Even Michael Bradley's seemingly half-hearted pursuit on the third goal the U.S. conceded against Costa Rica was simply a case of an exhausted player's losing his legs for a moment. It happens.

So what, then, was the key to last Saturday's turnaround? I would say a combination of (slightly) improved tactics, an inferior opponent and some lucky breaks. The U.S. will need a lot more than effort next week in the Confederations Cup. Bradley must get all his decisions correct, and players such as Dempsey and Landon Donovan need to play better than they have in recent games.

On the positive side, the U.S. will probably encounter a much less hostile environment in South Africa than it would have back home or on the road in CONCACAF.

Dollars and sense

So much for the global economic crisis affecting the European transfer market. In less than a week, Real Madrid made the New York Yankees look like penny-pinchers by shelling out 161 million euros on two players, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo. And with a number of other big stars -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Franck Ribery, for example -- probably on the move, this could go down as the craziest summer ever.

I don't know that anyone is worth 94 million euros -- the fee Madrid paid for Ronaldo -- but I have little doubt the Portuguese winger will flourish in Spain. As for Kaka, the expectation seems to be that a change of scenery will breathe new life into his career. I sure hope so, because he has quietly been on a downward slide the past couple of years.

Kaka reminds me of Ronaldinho after his fourth season at Barcelona: still a very good player who shows occasional glimpses of his peak form, but no longer capable of producing those performances on a consistent basis. It is a measure of how little attention was paid to AC Milan this season that Kaka can still fetch a bigger transfer fee than Alexandre Pato. Then again, most people were slow to realize that Lionel Messi had overtaken Ronaldinho as Barcelona's best player.

The Champions League winners seem unfazed by their archrival's spending, but it is the next signing that could put Madrid over the top. Real is reportedly closing in on Valencia striker David Villa, a player Barcelona should have been all over this offseason, rather than going after Ibrahimovic.

The additions of Villa, Ronaldo and Kaka likely will make Madrid the favorites in Spain, and legitimate contenders in the Champions League. The club might be destroying the sport in the process, but that is the price of success, I suppose."
91,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4247668/count/91/going-gold,MLS notebook,"While the majority of next year's U.S. World Cup squad is likely to be made up of those currently in South Africa for the Confederations Cup, it is clear there remains spots up for grabs. If timing is everything, there are a number of MLS-based Americans who are hitting top form at just the right moment.

Six days after the final of the Confederations Cup takes place in Johannesburg, the U.S. kicks off its Gold Cup campaign against Grenada on July 4 in Seattle, Wash. Regardless of how Bob Bradley's side fares in South Africa, it is likely that the squad that ends the first tournament of the summer will be vastly different than the team that kicks off the second. So, who are the candidates for inclusion?

With goals from open play proving nigh-on impossible for the national team at the present time, recent scoring displays from the Revolution's Taylor Twellman and the Galaxy's Edson Buddle could be a boost to the depth chart at forward. Meanwhile, Kenny Cooper has to be a shoo-in for selection. In the limited chances he's had at the international level, the FC Dallas man has shown promise, and is worthy of an opportunity to play a number of games in a row at the Gold Cup.

Among the midfielders Bradley's should be considering are the Houston Dynamo duo of Brad Davis, who offers a welcomed left-footed option, and Stuart Holden, whose development as an attacking threat from central areas has been very impressive. Beyond this Texas twosome is a couple from the capital city -- D.C. United's Santino Quaranta and Chris Pontius -- and the Seattle Sounders' Brad Evans, whose form is as consistent as it was in Columbus last season.

At the back is a trio of central defenders worthy of consideration. Bobby Boswell has emerged as the leader of a Houston defense that has allowed just seven goals in 11 games. Boswell made his international debut in 2006, the year that Cory Gibbs won the last of his 19 caps. Now finally over the string of injuries which caused him to miss two years, Gibbs is getting back to the form that made him a. force for the U.S in the World Cup.

Another defender worthy of a Gold Cup call-up is Jimmy Conrad, whose stock in national team circles appears to have fallen recently. Despite that, his form in MLS play has remained consistent, and he is capable of making a late run onto the 2010 squad similar to the way he did four years ago when he, along with Clint Dempsey and Brian Ching, forced his way onto Bruce Arena's roster in the year prior to the tournament.

Well played, returning man

The return of Twellman is arguably the most significant occurrence in this MLS season. The presence of the franchise's all-time leading scorer has transformed the Revs, who, until two weeks ago, were a side struggling to keep pace in the playoff chase.

During the 110 minutes that Twellman has been on the field this season, New England has scored five goals. Before he made his season debut, Steve Nicol's side found the net just nine times in 880 minutes. The 29-year-old Twellman's two goals on Sunday against New York took his career tally to 101, making him the youngest-ever to reach three figures.

Twellman's 101 goals came in 174 games, another league record, but perhaps even more impressive than that, just three of his goals have been on penalty kicks. None of the other four centurions -- Jaime Moreno, Ante Razov, Jason Kreis and Jeff Cunningham -- have a spot-kick tally in single digits.

The rest of the league should sit up and take notice of New England's display on Sunday. With Twellman back in the fold, Nicol's side has its spine restored and a spring back in its step.

A thing that made me go hmmm

When does a seat become too hot? There seems to be no hope for Juan Carlos Osorio in New York after the Red Bulls' latest road loss. The stats are well known -- of the nine points New York has collected in 2009, just one has been scored away from Giants Stadium, while the Red Bulls have failed to score once in a road game.

Five of the seven games New York will play before the all-star game are on the road, and the question now appears to be when, rather than if, the its coach will be relieved of his duties. It's been quite a fall from grace for the Colombian, who was pried away from Chicago by the Red Bulls -- at no small financial cost -- in December 2007.

Osorio took the Red Bulls to MLS Cup just eight months ago, and that, along with the money invested in recruiting him and building the team he wanted -- though it is hard to pinpoint one of his signings as a success -- is a reason why he may be given time to keep afloat what appears to be a sinking ship.

Even though there are few obvious candidates to step in and clean up the mess, especially in midseason, it seems that New York's players have either stopped playing for their coach or, more likely, are simply not good enough to save him. The likelihood is that Osorio will be fired sooner rather than later, in what is set to be the latest ugly chapter in the history of MLS' most underperforming franchise."
92,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4241553/count/91/question-marks-continue-surround-us,Monday afternoon musings,"From doom and gloom to lauding character and heart: I am, of course, talking about the U.S. national team's recent qualifiers (a 3-1 loss to Costa Rica and a 2-1 win over Honduras) that inspired a wide range of emotion from U.S. fans. While I caution people not to go overboard reading into these results -- while the U.S. was struggling, powerhouse Portugal was eking out a last-gasp win against mighty Albania -- I confess that, aside from the three points gained and the character shown against Honduras, I didn't see too many bright spots for the U.S. Here's what I'm thinking as we head into the build-up for the Confederations Cup:

1. The U.S. team's offensive woes. This has been an ongoing problem for the U.S. for as long as I can remember. Aside from the counterattacking heroics of the 2002 World Cup squad, the U.S. has habitually struggled going forward whenever faced with an opponent that is fairly organized on defense and (unlike the rest of CONCACAF) well-prepared to deal with set pieces. Outside of corners and set pieces, the U.S. rarely seems able to score or create chances -- even against CONCACAF defenses that aren't exactly bastions of defensive fortitude. We saw it again in the Costa Rica and Honduras games as the U.S. resorted to launching long ball after long ball forward. You can only get so far in international tournaments with this type of one-dimensional play.

Until the U.S. develops a more technical philosophy on offense and brings more imagination to its build-up play, it'll continue to struggle to score against top teams. I'm curious to know how much time the U.S. coaching staff spends on this. One national teamer I spoke with last year (off the record) told me he thought the U.S. spent far too much time working on set pieces and defensive positioning, and not enough time on offensive aspects.

2. The midfield puzzle. Of course, part of the offensive problem lies in the fact that the U.S. has not historically had any truly dangerous forwards or attacking players. With the potential of young players such as Jozy Altidore and Charlie Davies, there's at least some hope that one of them will develop into a capable finisher at the international level. However, the bigger problem is the lack of a technical and gifted creator in midfield. In 2002, the U.S. had a classy central midfield duo in John O'Brien and Claudio Reyna, which not only played the holding role adequately but also provided a link between the defense, the midfield and the offense. This is what the current team lacks, and it's a problem that has been compounded by coach Bob Bradley's preference at various times to field two holding/defensive midfielders -- as he did against Honduras, with the poorly conceived duo of Ricardo Clark and Pablo Mastroeni. It's no coincidence that the U.S. team's performance improved immeasurably once Mastroeni left the field and was replaced by Benny Feilhaber, who was able to provide a measure of the calm passing in the final third that was needed.

While Michael Bradley has started to mature into a very capable two-way box-to-box midfielder, I still think he's far better suited to a holding role with the U.S. It's the wrong move to pair him with a defensive midfielder such as Mastroeni, Clark or Maurice Edu, because the club then becomes reliant on his ability to create -- and that's not really his strength. It's imperative for the U.S. that Feilhaber, Freddy Adu, Jose Torres or Sacha Kljestan develops and plays alongside Bradley. Unfortunately, all of them come with various warts: Feilhaber has the most well-rounded ability of all four, but has a history of inury and attitude issues; Torres and Adu aren't trusted by Bradley for their lack of defensive discipline; and Kljestan has been far too inconsistent and turnover-prone.

3. What is Landon Donovan's best position? Is he a striker? Is he a withdrawn forward? I'm amazed this still is an issue. At this point, it should be fairly obvious to all that his best position at the international level is as a pseudo attacking midfield/winger out wide. It's no coincidence that virtually all of his best moments against top opponents in international football have come on the flanks, where he's able to run at people before cutting in and crossing or shooting. The only question is whether he should be used on the left or right side in this role, and that really just boils down to the quality of his partner on the opposite flank and the defensive matchup Donovan faces.

4. His time is done â¦ for now. It's also apparent that certain players, either because of a lack of form or declining ability, aren't deserving of their call-ups and, in some cases, starting roles. In this category I place DaMarcus Beasley, Heath Pearce and Mastroeni, none of whom should be on the U.S. team at present. In Beasley's case, I advocated trying him at left back, partly due to his lack of impact going forward at the left midfield spot and partly due to the lack of U.S. options at full back. Having said that, the last two games have shown that he lacks the defensive aptitude and positioning instincts to succeed at left back in the short term and shouldn't be risked playing there in the meantime.

5. Form versus playing time. Another problem the U.S. faces is that so many of its key players and best prospects have made the move to Europe and struggled to earn playing time there. This leads one to wonder, for example, whether to start a gifted forward who's riding the bench in Europe or a forward who's scoring freely in MLS. Not to disrespect the American league, but it's ridiculous to place too much weight on MLS performance and penalize players for heading overseas to higher-level leagues. There's a difference between a player who lacks form and one who lacks playing time -- the two can be mutually exclusive. Take Altidore and Beasley. Altidore was playing little at the club level before being used against T&T, whereupon he promptly bagged a hat trick. Then there's Beasley, who has barely played at club level in the past year. Whenever he has played -- at either club level or for the U.S. team -- Beasley has looked totally out of form and off the pace.

There are plenty of examples proving the flaws in favoring an MLS player who scores with abandon and appears ""in form"" over a player who hasn't seen much action in Europe. Goal scoring is a totally different proposition overseas. Look no further than Eddie Johnson. Or how about Conor Casey? Called up to the U.S. team after an eight-game scoring hot streak in MLS, Casey appeared less than sharp against Honduras and contributed nothing more than a lot of hustle and huffing and puffing.

It's this simple: The most talented players should be selected. Some fans seem to forget that the U.S. isn't like Spain or Argentina, clubs that can select from a multitude of world-class options on the basis of form or playing time. Sure, if either Xavi or Xabi Alonso is struggling in midfield, Spain can bring in Cesc. The U.S. and other lesser soccer powers don't have this luxury. Does anyone really think Egypt is going to bench Mohammed Zidan and Amr Zaki on the basis that both forwards have spent a vast amount of time this past year sitting on the bench for their club teams?

Confederations Cup

Various readers have asked for my predictions about how the U.S. will fare, so here they are:

I believe the U.S. will struggle to get a win and I've felt this ever since the draw was first announced. Against Italy (June 15, 2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360), I think the U.S. will try to play straight-up, but will fail to match the Italians in possession and lose. Against Brazil (June 18, 9:55 a.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360), I believe Bradley will revert to a hyper-defensive mentality, bunker and try to sneak in a set-piece goal. I could see the U.S. earning a draw here if it can keep a clean sheet. In the final game, against Egypt (June 21, 2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN360), I think the U.S. will try to take the game to the Egyptians for a win, but ultimately will fall prey on the counter to Mohamed Aboutrika and Co."
93,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4234458/count/91/the-mad-mad-world-mls,MLS notebook,"What a crazy league this is! Last weekend saw another round of matches that left fans scratching their heads over a number of topics.

First, how do you explain the Chicago Fire winning at the side with the league's best record, and then three days later, losing to the team with the worst record? The clue is in the question, of course. Seventy-two hours is not much time for a team to recover sufficiently. If several of those are spent traveling across time zones, the process becomes still more debilitating.

The result of the quick turnaround was a Fire side that made such a strong statement at Chivas USA -- albeit with the help of referee Terry Vaughn -- had little heat left for FC Dallas, whose own quest for victory was further assisted by the absence of Cuauhtemoc Blanco from the home side's lineup. The Hoops played well, but there is no doubt that the schedule did them a favor in this instance.

Elsewhere, another chapter was penned in the dominant story line of the season, as referees once again had a weekend to forget. I'll get to the number of cards that were dished out in a moment, but first, let's talk penalties. Of the six penalties awarded, at least four were laughers. Chicago was fortunate to get one, let alone two, at Chivas while the one New England gained from was arguably even worse. New York's penalty against Colorado was soft, too.

It seems that every time there is a coming-together in a penalty area, the result is a shout for a penalty. You can't blame players for asking, especially because so many penalties are being awarded, but there has to be some sort of reassessment of what is and what is not a spot-kick.

If a penalty is going to be given for a miniscule shirt tug, like the one on Wilman Conde or the bump Taylor Twellman took from Brian Namoff, we might as well put hoops on the field instead of goals, and give everyone the luxury of committing up to six fouls.

Forty-eight yellow cards is another cause for concern and a further indication of the present struggles of referees to do anything other than take names to establish and maintain control. The fact that 11 of those 48 were issued for dissent is a further sign of the growing lack of respect players have for match officials. Given some of the decisions we have seen recently, it's hardly surprising.

Size matters

It was a good weekend for many of MLS' ""big"" offensive players.

Leading the way was Conor Casey (6-foot-1, 170 pounds), whose stock as arguably the league's premier line-leader continues to grow. The Colorado man gave New York's back line fits to the extent that it contrived to allow him to net two goals from a combined distance of, roughly, 8 yards. Casey deservedly won the player of the month award in May, and should start the all-star game based on his current form.

Meanwhile, given that everything is bigger in Texas, it was perhaps not surprising to see Kenny Cooper (6-3, 207) and Kei Kamara (6-3, 186) excel for Dallas and Houston, respectively. Cooper has long been known for having a decent touch for one so large and his free-kick strike against Chicago was further evidence of that.

Kamara, meanwhile, is one of the quiet success stories of the past month, when he has responded admirably to the threat of shared playing time with the addition of, Ade Akinbyi. Since the veteran forward joined the Dynamo, Kamara has scored three goals in four games -- all of which Houston has won after starting the season with four barren outings.

In New England, much of the weekend's attention was on the return of Taylor Twellman, as well as the latest questionable penalty decision by a referee. Beyond those talking points was another colossal display by the Revolution's main man, Shalrie Joseph (6-3, 180). Twellman's introduction may have allowed the Grenadian to revert to his regular role in midfield, but Joseph maintained an offensive outlook, heading in his fourth goal of the season to draw Steve Nicol's side level.

Other physically imposing forwards to find the net were Nate Jaqua (6-3, 180), whose form with the Seattle Sounders FC has been admirably consistent, and Edson Buddle (6-1, 185), a player the Galaxy desperately needs to get and stay fit, especially given the penchant Alan Gordon (6-3, 190 -- hey, I didn't say all of the tall guys excelled!) has developed for missing gilt-edged chances.

So, what explains the success of the big men? First and foremost, service was the key. Having berated the standard of crossing and set-piece delivery in recent weeks, it's only fair that I compliment some of the crosses we saw last weekend. With the exception of Cooper's dead-ball effort, all of the above benefited from having the right ball played at the right time.

Furthermore, though this trend is not restricted to the big men, it was noticeable from the box scores how many forward pairings linked up on goals. One of Casey's was assisted by Omar Cummings, while Brian Ching played a part in Kamara's strike. Unsurprisingly, Landon Donovan was the key to Buddle pulling the Galaxy level.

Well played, forgotten man

I'll give a nod to the continued good form of Brad Davis, who excelled against Toronto FC with a goal and an assist to take his season's tally in those categories to two and seven, respectively. The 27-year-old has set-up a goal in each of Houston's last six games, which is a franchise record and two short of the league's mark.

Davis has impressed me for a number of years, and he played instrumental roles in each of the Dynamo's MLS Cup wins. His ability to play centrally as well as out wide was showcased on both occasions, and that versatility continues to serve him well as he stuffs the stats sheet during Houston's resurgence.

Perhaps Davis is worth another look from the national team. Bob Bradley is not exactly overrun with creative, left-footed players, after all. Davis made his mark with the winning penalty in the 2005 Gold Cup final shootout, and this year's tournament appears to offer him another opportunity to make an impact in U.S. colors.

A thing that made me go hmmm

When will D.C. United coach Tom Soehn make a decision about his first-choice goalkeeper? Through 12 games, three men -- Louis Crayton (6), Josh Wicks (4) and Milos Kocic (2) -- have taken turns minding the net, and it is fair to say the results have been mixed. D.C. has shut out just two opponents and has an overall goals against average of 1.42.

Perhaps that is the problem. Simply, none of the three has shown sufficient ability to claim the starting job. Crayton appears to be the best option, but his tendency to go walkabout has burned him the past. Wicks was an accident waiting to happen last year in L.A., and while he has improved, it still appears that most of the saves he makes occur when he is recovering from being out of position. Kocic, meanwhile, has shown an affliction to crosses.

Though each has his flaws, the time is now for Soehn to pick and stick with one of his keepers. Defenders like the familiarity of having the same man behind them, and an extended run in the side would immediately boost the confidence of whoever wins the job. The knock-on effect would be to push D.C. to new levels and possibly challenge for the Eastern Conference title."
94,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4227466/count/91/red-bulls-need-little-luck,Red Bulls in need of a little luck,"First off, I enjoyed reading all your feedback from my last post on steroids. It was a tough topic for me to write about because only bits and pieces of the situation have become public. It's not like it was the lead story on SportsCenter or on the front pages of every paper. One day MLS will no doubt receive that kind of attention, but until then, investigative reporting will have to do.

As I wake up every morning in the greatest place on earth, the New Jersey shore, I have a smile on my face. My alarm clock radio wakes me up with either Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a Prayer"" or Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" (in my humble opinion, the two greatest songs in rock history). Outside, there's the gentle hum of a Mustang 5.0 or an IROC Z28 (depending on which neighbor is leaving early). I open the window to hear the waves crashing (or more like ripples easing onto the beach) and the birds chirping (OK, seagulls begging) and take a deep breath of salty fresh sea air and proclaim ""What a beautiful day"". Then I open up the paper over a cup of coffee and flip to the MLS standings.

Suddenly the clouds roll in and the seagulls cover my front porch with their special white sauce. My morning that started so blissfully is nothing more than a memory now. To make matters worse, this is about the time that my 4-year-old son, whose church league team holds a stellar 6-2 W-L record reminds me of the situation with a smart comment such as ""Daddy, you should come practice with my team. We are really good."" As he walks away and gets tripped by yours truly, I am at a low. Maybe he is onto something. To watch him and his band of crazies play the beautiful game every Saturday morning is an incredible event. They play without a care in the world. No consequences, contracts, screaming coaches or worry of losing. Then my wife smacks me in the back of the head informing me that it's time to head to practice.

I walk out the door thinking about our (New York Red Bulls) recent run of bad results. Although I believe in Karma and luck it's only to a certain extent. The fact that we have limited our opponents to far less scoring opportunities than we have created means nothing if they are the ones scoring. Take our game against the Chicago Fire two weeks ago. They came into the game unbeaten in their last eight games. They may have had only two total shots in the first half but walked into halftime up 1-0, which ended up being the final score.

Or take our last game against the Colorado Rapids. We had numerous opportunities in the first half and limited them to only a few. Yet again we went into halftime down 1-0. Anybody who knows the game can see that we have good players and are capable of putting together great moments on the field. However, the game is about more than great moments. It's about great games, finishing your chances and stopping your opponents' chances. It's about managing games. And yes, it's about a little bit of luck once and a while. With eight out of our next nine games being road trips (starting with the game against D.C. on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2), we're going to need some of that luck that has eluded us so far this season."
95,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4221516/count/91/us-the-defensive-costa-rica,Monday morning musings,"It's certainly nice to see that U.S. fans have confidence in their team -- an overwhelming 75 percent of them on our Soccernet poll believe the U.S. will win in Saprissa on Wednesday, when the U.S. takes on Costa Rica (10 p.m. ET, ESPN, ESPN360). I can't say I have the same level of confidence. We're talking about a road game at a place where the U.S. has never won a qualifier and has a 0-6-1 record. Not to mention how nervous the U.S. looked in the hostile environment in El Salvador, where it barely escaped with a point. Anyway here's what I'm thinking Monday:

1. The U.S. lineup against Costa Rica. I fully expect coach Bob Bradley to be on the back foot and select a more defensive lineup for this game given the acknowledged difficulties of this matchup and the fact that the U.S. will be happy with just earning a point in Saprissa. Given that Jozy Altidore isn't 100 percent match fit, it's extremely unlikely the U.S. will field two forwards and I expect it will open in some variation of a 4-5-1 with Brian Ching as the lone striker. Debating the merits of whether or not Ching should start would take up a whole blog in itself. However, while I believe Ching is best utilized as part of a two-forward lineup in a 4-4-2 alongside someone like Altidore -- for this game I do think he's the best choice.

Given that the U.S. is likely to be under heavy pressure, the midfield needs an outlet to pass to, someone who can hold up/keep the ball and then lay it off. There's only one U.S. forward on the current national team outside of the retired Brian McBride who is proven to be capable of doing this, and that's Ching. Where Ching falls short compared to McBride is in his ability to score at the international level against higher-class opposition, so in a game in which you play with a lone forward and you're counting on that forward for goals, Ching probably isn't the best option. For the game in Saprissa though, and for the tactical role that Bradley will require his lone forward to play, Ching makes the most sense. As for the rest of the starting 11 and assuming that Frankie Hejduk is out, I think the key decision for Bradley is having to choose between starting either one of his former Chivas protÃ©gÃ©s, Jonathan Bornstein or Sacha Kljestan -- and I think that choice will boil down to who's been better in camp. This being the case, I think Bradley will opt for one of the two following lineups:

GK -- Tim Howard; D -- Jonathan Spector, Oguchi Onyewu, Carlos Bocanegra, Bornstein; LM -- DaMarcus Beasley; CM -- Michael Bradley, Pablo Mastroeni; RM -- Clint Dempsey; AM -- Landon Donovan; F -- Ching

Or alternatively, GK -- Howard; D -- Spector, Onyewu, Bocanegra, Beasley; LM -- Donovan; CM -- Bradley, Mastroeni; RM -- Dempsey; AM -- Kljestan; F -- Ching

2. Showdown in Chinatown Part 2. Those of you who were present for Steve Nash's charity game in New York last year witnessed the spectacle of NBA stars and soccer stars turning out to benefit Nash's foundation. Well, the good news is that the event is back and scheduled to take place once again in Chinatown on June 24. From what I'm hearing, the organizers expect bigger names to participate this year and if this video promo is anything to go by, we could be in for a real treat (although given that Brazil is likely to be playing in the Confederations Cup on that date, I'd say the chances of Kaka appearing are slim to none). For a chance to win an all-expenses-paid trip to the event, you can go to the Football For Good Web site.

3. Howard's FA Cup performance I have to say that I think Howard has received a ludicrous amount for criticism for allowing Frank Lampard's game-winning goal for Chelsea. Granted, Howard could possibly have done better given that he did manage to get a hand to it, but at the same time I'd argue he actually did pretty well to get a hand on it. Even if one agrees with the line of thought that it was a savable shot, it still doesn't qualify as a goalkeeping mistake or error, which is how it's largely been portrayed. An example of dodgy goalkeeping or an actual goalkeeping error would be this, not Howard's effort on Saturday.

4. Ancelotti takes the reigns at Chelsea As had been widely rumored, former AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has officially taken over from Guus Hiddink at Chelsea. I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Ancelotti fan -- I think he's a tad overrated and questionable with his tactics over the long haul of a domestic league season. Chelsea fans better get used to a variety of head-shaking decisions involving taking off all your team's strikers when trailing 1-0. For that reason, I can't imagine that Ancelotti will be any better for Chelsea in the English league than the failed Phil Scolari was. However, presumably the hope is that Ancelotti will be an improvement over Scolari in European play. With the Champions League becoming an obsession for owner Roman Abramovich -- this summer's huge projected spending on a couple of more marquee players flies in the face of everything Chelsea have said the past few years about fiscal responsibility, being self-funding and no longer reliant on Abramovich's largesse -- Ancelotti will be under extreme pressure to deliver.

5. Where now for Owen? It's rather sad to see the continued decline of Michael Owen, who ended the Premiership season on the bench for a pitiful Newcastle team. There's no question that he'll be moving on this summer as a free agent, but considering his weekly salary (approx $160,000), decline in productivity and injury-plagued past, which top team is likely to make a play for him? I think Everton will make a push to sign him, but the most intriguing option could come from Liverpool if Rafa Benitez decides he could fill a role as a backup striker. Granted, a large part of the Kop have never forgiven him for the way in which he left the club for Real Madrid in 2004 (a move which I argued at the time would be highly detrimental for him) -- but if Owen is willing to take a pay cut and if his ego can handle the supporting role to Fernando Torres, then he'd be a smart acquisition. His loss of speed means Owen is no longer a real threat to create goals on his own, but he's still a quality finisher and certainly more adept as a secondary option than French youngster David N'Gog.

That's all from me for now, I'll be back on Wednesday night with a live play-by-play of the U.S. game against Costa Rica."
96,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4214878/count/91/andres-giant,Andres the Giant,"Barcelona was far better than Manchester United in winning its third European Cup on Wednesday night. Don't take it from me. Sir Alex Ferguson said as much in his postgame press conference, as he congratulated his opponents on a deserved victory.

Perhaps the greatest testament to the superiority of the Catalans in Rome is that even Ferguson was unable to conjure up any excuses for his side's 2-0 defeat. There was no chirping about the officiating, no moaning about the play-acting of Barcelona's stars.

As disappointed as he must be, Ferguson probably recognizes what a positive outcome this was for the sport. Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool are all great teams, but none of them plays quite like Barcelona. And the way Barcelona plays has very little to do with its two goal scorers, Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi.

Barcelona's trump card on Wednesday (and throughout this season) was the midfield duo of Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez. Iniesta, in particular, has experienced a remarkable growth in stature in a short period of time. Not even a regular starter last season, he is now a legitimate candidate for the title of best player in the world.

I've seen quite a few Barcelona games this season and, of course, there have been a few lousy performances. But I don't recall a single game with these two in the middle of the park -- Iniesta is occasionally employed as a left winger when Thierry Henry is out -- in which Barcelona didn't control possession and dictate the rhythm.

The match against United was no different. Truth be told, the Red Devils didn't put up much of a fight. With Paul Scholes aging quite a bit in one year, and Anderson suffering a sophomore slump, the central midfield was a legitimate weakness this season, masked against most opposition by the team's incredible quality in other areas.

But against the two best midfields it faced all year -- Liverpool and Barcelona -- a Manchester United team that flirted with a quintuple (and at one point this season was mentioned as one of the greatest sides ever) was made to appear very ordinary.

As for Messi, he did come out on top in his much-anticipated duel against Cristiano Ronaldo, I'm not even sure Messi played that well, but the Argentine scored and his team won. As a result, he will invariably sweep the end-of-year awards this time around. What may get overlooked in the process, however, is that Messi was able to count on one enormous advantage Wednesday: He plays with Xavi and Iniesta.

While Ronaldo was often reduced to chasing down clearances from his defenders, Messi had every ball played to his feet, or his head, at the perfect time, and with the proper pace. For Barcelona's attackers, service is guaranteed.

If Messi is indeed the best player on the planet, much of the credit has to go to the diminutive pair. The same is true for Henry's improbable resurgence this season, or for Eto'o pumping in nearly 30 league goals despite his not being the same player after suffering various injuries.

Even before Barcelona's triumph, the tide had been turning in recent years. Very few of the world's top clubs and national teams still pack the midfield with defensive cloggers, as managers instead opt for more technical players who can control the game with their passing.

It is certainly the more enjoyable approach, and now a case can be made that it's the most effective one. The hope is that Wednesday's result will convert the last few holdouts. If he wasn't already, Ferguson is certainly a believer."
97,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4208056/count/91/mls-seeing-red,Midweek MLS notebook,"Through 75 games so far this season, referees have booked 263 players and sent off 24. In the wake of another weekend in which more cards were issued (24 yellow, three red) than there were goals scored (17), it's time for the league -- and U.S. Soccer, for that matter -- to address what is becoming an increasing concern.

The decision to caution or, especially, to send off, seems to be too quickly and readily taken. Compare MLS this season with the recently concluded Premier League season in England. While the yellow card count per games was similar -- 3.51 here as opposed to 3.13 in England -- the difference in the numbers of sendings-off is staggering. In the EPL in 2008-09, a red card was issued once every 6.03 games. In MLS, someone is sent for an early bath every 3.13 matches.

The fault for this epidemic of cards lies, in my opinion, almost equally at the feet of referees and players, two factions who appear to be at almost-constant odds with one another. While referees often apply the letter of the law too strictly, players are culpable of taking liberties, which are often borne out of a lack of respect for the match official, as well as for each other.

Refs need to lighten up

Somebody once said to me that the reason people become referees is because each time they blow their whistle, everyone looks at them. Now, I don't know much about the relative attention cravings of that those take charge of MLS games, but one thing I have concluded is that too many referees cannot wait to get their cards out.

Few engage in dialogue with players, with debate forsaken in favor of rigid discipline. When was the last time you saw an official smile and look like he was enjoying his work? Not necessarily to the extent that Jair Marrufo took things when he left a recent game with Cuauhtemoc Blanco's shirt, but certainly in the general running of a match, there is little positive interaction between officials and players. Were there to be, the chances are that everyone would relax a little more and be able to do their job better.

Mind you, the pressure referees are under never has been greater. TV cameras allow every incident to be scrutinized while, as welcome as it is to us fans, U.S. Soccer's publication of their thoughts on what refs get right and wrong does them few favors. Knowing the assessments of their performances will be published inevitably leads to an approach which more readily applies the letter of the law, rather than one which takes into account the benefit of the doubt. If you stick rigidly to the rules, you never can be wrong, right?

The result of this obsession with the rule book has been a succession of matches dominated by stoppages and flashpoints, which make flowing soccer harder to achieve. Furthermore, the card chaos may help explain why MLS has seen so many ties -- 31 of 75 games have ended level.

Teams playing a man down inevitably have to be more cautious, often sacrificing an attacking, flair player for a more defensively minded option. The space created by the reduced numbers is usually available on the flanks, but such has been the dearth of quality wide play thus far in 2009 that there are few teams able to take advantage.

Players need to wise up

Players also deserve to have the finger pointed at them. The red card stats show that while five players have been sent off for a second yellow and the same number have gone for denying a goal-scoring opportunity, a whopping 13 have been expelled from games for either violent conduct or serious foul play.

Through the course of a game, picking up two bookings or pulling down an opponent when he is through on goal is more understandable and, dare I say it, forgivable, than, for example, slapping an opponent (James Riley), throwing an elbow (Fredy Montero, Jorge Rojas) or going over the ball in a challenge to implant your studs into somebody's shin (Andy Iro, Jamison Olave, Dema Kovalenko).

That so many players have been sent off for these violent actions suggests to me that there is a discipline issue in MLS. Players have not learned that, whether rightly or wrongly, referees seem to view a ""card first, ask questions later"" approach as the best way to solve on-field issues and, therefore, must be smart enough to realize what the implications are if they push their luck too far.

Bradley's selection conundrums

Next Wednesday marks the start of an important few weeks for the national team, as Bob Bradley's side embarks on a busy schedule which will see it compete in three different competitions. With the Confederations and Gold Cups to come, the first order of business is to move closer to qualification for next year's World Cup. These games in Costa Rica (June 3, 10 p.m. ET, ESPN) and at home to Honduras (June 6, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN) will provide decent tests for the U.S.

There were few surprises in the squad Bradley selected (though I did half-expect Josh Wolff to be recalled), and the names listed are likely to form the nucleus of the party that will travel to South Africa in a year's time. That said, however, the coach does have some decisions to make regarding the way he approaches each qualifier.

Given the pragmatic approach we have seen from Bradley in the past, I expect him to approach the Costa Rica game with caution, deploying Brian Ching as a lone striker with Landon Donovan possibly starting on the left. That move would allow an extra central midfielder to feature, meaning we could see Maurice Edu and Pablo Mastroeni alongside Michael Bradley.

The other big call comes at left back, with Jonathan Bornstein, Jonathan Spector and DaMarcus Beasley -- who started there against Trinidad and Tobago -- the men in contention. While many are keen for the Beasley experiment to continue, I would not be surprised if his lack of recent playing time as well as his inexperience in the position means that he is overlooked and Spector is given the nod.

Three days later, expect a more attacking lineup to be picked against Honduras. Beasley may be given another chance in defense while Jozy Altidore, injury permitting, seems certain to start alongside Ching. That would mean one fewer player in midfield, and my personal opinion is that Edu deserves the chance to make that spot his own, at the expense of Mastroeni.

Well played, revitalized man

After his latest match-winning display, Amado Guevara has to be considered a shoo-in for the All-Star starting lineup. If he can maintain the form that has seen him produce five goals and four assists in 10 games so far in 2009, the Honduran veteran will have to be considered a candidate to win his second MVP award.

Guevera is excelling in a side that has, to date, gotten few goals from its forwards -- Chad Barrett is TFC's most ""prolific"" striker with two goals -- and his dynamic partnership with Dwayne De Rosario, who himself has four goals and an assist, has been one of the main features of Toronto's recent form, which shows just one defeat in six league games.

After his career appeared to be on the wane following his exit from New York, Guevara has enjoyed a resurgence north of the border, and Toronto fans are reaping the benefits. Interim coach Chris Cummins has solidified the side's back line, which has allowed its creative elements to focus on their offensive responsibilities. After a slow start, suddenly the first playoff appearance in franchise history is back on the radar screen.

Champions League final

With the big game set to kick off today (2:25 p.m. ET, ESPN, ESPN360), here's a fun video that sees Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs engaging in some good-natured ribbing."
98,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4203927/count/91/maldini-career-ends-sour-note,Monday morning musings,"Following a rousing final weekend of action in some of Europe's top leagues, here are my thoughts on this Memorial Day Monday:

1. The U.S. roster for the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers. Bear in mind that the 24-man roster that coach Bob Bradley selected is a training camp roster and not the final roster that will face Costa Rica (June 3) and Honduras (June 6). Aston Villa defender Eric Lichaj and Kaiserslautern goalkeeper Luis Robles have also been extended invites. That said, aside from the inclusion of woefully-out-of-form Heath Pearce, what's not to like about this roster? Bringing in Marvell Wynne is a good move, as is taking a closer look to see where Benny Feilhaber is now that he's over his injuries and has finally started playing again. Given his early-season form in Sweden, it's also no surprise that Charlie Davies is back on the roster in place of Eddie Johnson. The only other quibble I have is Danny Califf -- but for whatever reason he's seemingly entrenched as Bradley's No. 3 choice at center back.

2. The retirement of a legend. Count me among those who are extremely sad to see AC Milan's Paolo Maldini heading for retirement at the end of the season. Granted, it's probably about time, but it's still a pity to see arguably the greatest defender of the past two decades hang up his boots. The Maldini tradition at Milan (his father, Cesare, was also a noted defender for the Rossoneri) is alive and well, though, as his 13-year-old son Christian is progressing through the Milan youth academy as a fullback and is well-regarded. Failing that, there's always youngest son Daniel, who in this now-legendary clip from two years ago, is seen dispossessing a stunned Clarence Seedorf (Daniel was just 5 years old at the time), proving that it's all in the genes when it comes to the Maldini clan.

That said, Maldini's final appearance at the San Siro ended on a sour note. Not only did Milan lose 3-2 by Roma, but a small section of the Milan fans jeered Maldini on his lap of honor by unfurling a banner of former captain and fellow legend Franco Baresi and chanting ""there's only one Franco Baresi."" Classless behavior and it visibly upset Maldini.

3. Champions League showdown. With Man United and Barcelona set to face off this Wednesday (2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN, ESPN360), there's no question in my mind that United are the favorites heading into the game. United are well-rested, healthy and facing a banged-up Barca squad that will be missing three key defenders through injury and suspension. If that wasn't bad enough, doubts still remain about the availability of Thierry Henry and Andres Iniesta. While it's likely both players will play, they're not likely to be close to 100 percent and any drop-off in Iniesta's usual level of play is likely to be a critical blow to Josep Guardiola's team. While United will miss the suspended Darren Fletcher, they'll still be more or less at full strength.

Despite this, I believe Sir Alex Ferguson will once again adopt the ultradefensive counterattacking strategy he utilitized last year when United overcame Barcelona in the Champions League semis. You might even see Cristiano Ronaldo deployed once again as a center forward with Wayne Rooney and Park Ji Sung supporting him on the wings. Although I predict a 1-0 victory for United (courtesy of a Nemanja Vidic header off a set piece or corner), admittedly I'd like to see Barcelona win it as a reward for playing the most consistently attractive football anywhere in Europe all season long.

4. All change for Wolfsburg? For neutrals it was a pleasure to see Wolfsburg clinch the Bundesliga title with yet another resounding display of attacking football (demolishing Bremen 5-1 in its final game). However, whoever in the Wolfsburg board is responsible for losing coach Felix Magath (Magath has agreed to coach Schalke next season) needs to get his head examined. Outside of Barcelona (and prompted by the explosive forward duo of Grafite and Edin Dzeko with an astounding 54 goals between them), Wolfsburg has played some of the most exhilarating football this season and it's a shame that the team is not likely to remain intact next season.

As for Dzeko, he's a phenomenal talent who's capable of scoring in every which way possible and is surely destined for a big-four club in either the Premiership or La Liga this summer. Neven Subotic-haters probably took great joy in seeing Dzeko shred the Dortmund defense back on May 12, and in particular on a couple of plays where Dzeko made Subotic look absolutely amateur.

Sporting Smiles

Before I sign off for today, I'd like to bring a couple of worthy causes to your attention. The first is from an e-mail I received from Ian Sarachan, who's the son of Galaxy coach Dave Sarachan. Ian founded an organization called Sporting Smiles a year or so ago to assist less fortunate kids around the country in their dreams and athletic aspirations. The site collects new and used sporting gear for donation and also sells soccer memorabilia and T-shirts with all proceeds going toward purchasing new gear.

Street Soccer USA

For those who aren't aware, the upcoming Street Soccer USA Cup is taking place in Washington, D.C., from July 31 to Aug. 2. Street Soccer USA is a nonprofit organization that helps homeless and impoverished youth and adults. In preparation for the Street Soccer cup, Street Soccer and CALLE have announced a partnership to create special limited-edition pieces of street art for sale to the public (initially on T-shirts) to raise revenues for the event. For more information about Street Soccer USA and to attend the SSUSA Cup 2009 visit the Street Soccer Web site."
99,http://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/soccer/id/4199456/count/91/adu-avoid-u-20-world-cup,Adu should avoid U-20 World Cup,"As if getting Wally Pipp'd in last Friday's podcast wasn't bad enough, I had to listen to Ives Galarcep allude to what I believe is one of the most ludicrous stories involving a U.S. player -- the notion that Freddy Adu might actually play in another U-20 World Cup (it would be his fourth).

The thinking goes that since Adu hasn't seen the light of day at club level, playing in the competition will provide some much-needed time on the field and offer him a platform to boost his stock in Europe. But the proper solution, of course, is for Adu's agent to do his job this time around and find a team where his client can actually play.

There surely must be some European club in one of the top five or six leagues able to offer him some minutes. The worst-case scenario for Adu would be to find said club and have his progress derailed by leaving for a month to take part in a youth tournament, as this year's edition of the U-20s takes place from Sept. 24-Oct. 16, when European leagues are typically in full swing.

As for showcasing himself, Adu will be hard-pressed to improve upon his impressive performances from two years ago in Canada, which netted him only a 2 million euro transfer to Benfica. The lack of interest in Adu only confirmed my suspicion that European clubs are giving less and less credence to this competition.

With young phenoms making the breakthrough to the professional ranks faster than ever before, there is now often a sizeable enough sample at the senior level to make an evaluation of a player before he even reaches this tournament. Most of the stars at the recent U-20 World Cups arrived as already well-known commodities.

Such a development might not please U.S. supporters, who have always placed a disproportionate amount of importance on these youth tournaments, especially in terms of results. Even Argentina, the winningest country in the history of the U-20s, is adamant that the primary objective is to develop impact players for the senior national team.

In the case of Adu, I'd argue U.S. soccer has already succeeded in that mission, but coach Bob Bradley evidently feels otherwise. Nevertheless, this debate shouldn't continue in Egypt.

Scrubs from Brazil

Whichever players the U.S. sends to the Confederations Cup this summer had their task made much easier by Brazil coach Dunga's inability to get his head out of the sand. On Thursday, Brazil became the first opponent of the U.S. to announce its squad, and the list contains the usual head-scratchers -- Dunga never fails to disappoint.

About the only thing he got right was to leave out Ronaldo, and instead select a domestic-based striker actually deserving of an opportunity in Nilmar. He has also indicated in interviews he plans to give more of an opportunity to Alexandre Pato, only the best Brazilian player in the world who has yet to even crack the starting XI.

But all the firepower up front won't matter unless Dunga builds a midfield with greater quality. The inclusion of Cruzeiro's Ramires is a small step in the right direction, but somehow there is still no room for Sao Paulo star Hernanes, the type of player who can get Brazil back to the free-flowing style they used to play once upon a time.

Sadly, the great purveyors of the beautiful game -- how outdated is that reputation? -- are saddled with a coach who views the world through the prism of the 1994 team he captained, which means the concept of employing anything other than defensive cloggers in the holding midfield positions is beyond him.

In that World Cup, Brazil defeated the United States by a meager 1-0 score (Dunga's dream scenario). Don't expect too many more goals this time around."
